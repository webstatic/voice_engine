2) NOTES

   * *kanjidb.sqlite*:<br />
      '*frequency*' column in compverbs, edict, jukugo tables: frequencies marked with a * are ambiguous. For example, 七 is read シチ and なな. It is impossible to know which reading the frequency is based on. Frequencies are based on an analysis of over 5,000 novels.<br />
      '*particles*' column in compverbs, edict, jukugo tables: join with *sentences.particle* to output sentences containing that particle+word (parse first if multiple particles)<br />
      * conjugations table:<br />
             * *conjugations.search*: each reading is enclosed with ";" to "simulate" full-text-search (FTS) of Japanese without a tokenizer<br />
      * elements table:<br />
             * *elements.grade*: 1=jouyou, 2=jinmeiyou, 3=hyougaiji<br />
             * *elements.idc*: ideographic description character (kanji shape); see *idc_mappingtable.txt* for mapping table to images in *idc_images* folder<br />
             * *elements.elements*: 3-byte characters for multi-elements lookup system; see *multielements.txt* for element list (for example, "屶 = 山": show 山 on website/app, but search for 屶)<br />
             * *elements.extra_elements*: for input box to search for kanji that contain a certain kanji (non-radicals that are not on the multi-elements lookup system only), for example, search for 合 will return 姶, 恰, etc.<br />
             * *elements.kanji_parts*: list of elements that the kanji is made of (different from *elements.elements*; doesn't show 屶 for example but only 山)<br />
             * *elements.part_of*: list of kanji that contain the particular kanji<br />
      * kanjidict table (note the "T" to separate it from KANJIDIC):<br />
             * *kanjidict.reg_on* & *kanjidict.reg_kun*: readings marked with * are less common<br />
             * *kanjidict.frequency*: mean of various frequency lists<br />
             * *kanjidict.meaning*: three labels are appended to some kanji as the last meaning, but they should ideally be a separate field: *(kokuji)*, *(extended shinjitai)*, *(ghost character)*<br />
             * *kanjidict.compact_meaning*: common meanings (limited to jouyou kanji only)<br />
      * pinyin table:<br />
             * *pinyin.pinyin*: readings in brackets are exclusive to Taiwan<br />
      * search table:<br />
             * *search.reg_reading* & *search.reading*: each reading is enclosed with ";" to "simulate" full-text-search (FTS) of Japanese without a tokenizer<br />
      * segments table:<br />
             * *segments.location*: location where the reading is: *J*=jukugo, *C*=compverbs, *Y*=yojijukugo. Combinations are also possible: *CY*, *JC*, *JY*<br />
      * sentences table:<br />
             * *sentences.obi2*: this is the Obi-2 readability score of the sentence (http://kotoba.nuee.nagoya-u.ac.jp/sc/obi2/obi_e.html)<br /> 
      * variants table:<br />
             * *variants.traditional*: traditional Chinese (Taiwan) characters. *(C)* means the character is frequently used (Common) in Taiwan<br />
             * *variants.simplified*: simplified Chinese characters. *(C)* means the character is frequently used (Common) in Mainland China<br />
             * *variants.simplified2*: ultra-simplified Chinese (non-official simplifications, requires *Ultra-simplified.woff/svg* font to view)<br />
             * *variants.ryakuji*: common ryakuji characters. Requires *ryakuji.woff/svg* font to view correctly<br />

   This should cover the ambiguities in the database. Everything else is (hopefully) covered at http://igg.me/at/kanjiproject.

   * Other notes:<br />
      * The following kanji have duplicate index numbers (RTK, KO): 𠮟,叱; 塡,填; 剝,剥; 頰,頬; 喻,喩; 籠,篭; 箋,䇳, and 𠮟 & 叱 also have identical frequency ranks<br />
      * It is very likely some kanji past the 6,355 mark (including the jouyou kanji 𠮟 above), radical variants and phonetics will not render on some mobile devices or even computers because the required fonts are not installed. For some cases, it is required to have the *HanaMinA* & *HanaMinB* (http://fonts.jp/hanazono/) (or similar) fonts installed! 3 phonetics and 1 kanji are not even encoded in Unicode (last 4 in the tables), and are assigned a Private Use Area code<br />
      * Onyomi words (e.g. 一 ichi) in the edict table are written with katakana, as opposed to hiragana in Jim Breen's EDICT/JMdict, thus they need to be converted before trying to synchronize with EDICT/JMdict<br />
      * */data/accent.css* is an example CSS file to properly render the pitch accent information<br />

   * */data/source_files/raw* folder:<br />
      * *accents.txt*: file containing pitch accent mora locations for 124,137 words. Use this to generate pitch accent data for any other words not in my database<br />
      * *particles.txt*: file containing particle+verb pairs, Japanese sentences and English translations (from Tatoeba). Use this to extract particle data for any other verbs not in my database<br />
      * *wikipedia_freq.txt*: file containing word frequency based on an analysis of Japanese Wikipedia<br />
      * *novels_freq.txt*: file containing word frequency based on an analysis of over 5,000 novels<br />
      * *mecab-furigana.rb* & *furigana.rb*: Ruby scripts to generate furigana; author is "lauri_ranta"<br />
      * *word_segmentation.txt*: link to a Python script (Ryuujouji) by Houssam Salem to segment words into individual character readings. The script is not a part of this package due to its GPL license. Also note that the script does not currently take renjou (連声) into account, but there are not a lot of such words in the Japanese language<br />

   * */images* folder:<br />
      * All the images are saved with a character's decimal numeric character reference as the filename<br />

   * */misc* folder:<br />
      * *ghost.txt*: "ghost kanji" - questionable characters that were encoded into the JIS X 02xx standards (and Unicode) by mistake<br />
      * *repeat.txt*: kanji where one element repeats 3 times<br />
      * *xxx_yypercent.txt*: x number of kanji required to read y percent of Wikipedia<br />
      * *surnames.txt*: some of the most common Japanese surnames and the kanji required to know how to read them<br />
      * *boynames.txt*: some of the most common Japanese boy names and the kanji required to know how to read them<br />
      * *girlnames.txt*: some of the most common Japanese girl names and the kanji required to know how to read them<br />
      * *unknown.txt*: kanji with no known meaning<br />
      * *future.txt*: jouyou kanji that should be simplified, but probably won't be<br />
      * *common_elements.txt*: most frequent elements kanji are composed of<br />
      * *confusing_okurigana.txt*: words where different readings share the same okurigana<br />
      * *irregular_readings.txt*: some words/place names with weird or irregular (missing okurigana) readings<br />
      * *jukujikun.txt*: list of official jukujikun and below a list of unofficial jukujikun<br />
