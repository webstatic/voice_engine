/// 2: Onomatopoeia
/// (1) What is onomatopoeia?
/// The term onomatopoeia refers to words that originate in imitation of actual sounds.
/// In Japanese, onomatopoeic words, which often contain repeated syllables, are usually written in katakana.

雨がぜーせー（と）降ります。//It’s raining heavily.

/// the quotative particle と connects the verb and the content of the quote, thoughts, or sounds.
/// The use of this particle is optional when the onomatopoeia contains repeated syllables.

/// # Quoting
/// in this quotation structure, と connects what someone has said and the verb 言（い）う（いいます） “to say.”

ずんだもんさんは「この寿司は美味しいです。」と言いました。//Zundamon-san said, ‘This sushi is delicious.’

/// When reporting only the content rather than something verbatim, remove the quotation marks and use the plain form for the content.

ずんだもんさんはこの寿司は美味しいと言いました。//Zundamon-san said the sushi was delicious.

/// # Expressing thoughts
/// the speaker may express an opinion or idea by connect ing his or her own thought with と and the verb 思（おも）う（おもいます） “to think.”
/// In this case, the predicate form before と must be in the plain form.
/// This verb is used to express the speaker’s own thought; it is not used when the topic is in the third person.
/// When questioning the addressee directly for his or her opinion, the second person may be used in the topic position.

私はこの寿司は美味しいと思います。//I think that this sushi is delicious.

/// (2) Types of onomatopoeia
/// Besides the onomatopoeia that originate in imitation of actual sounds, there are also other types of onomatopoeia in Japanese: e.g., onomatopoeia of manner and description, which mimic the manner of some activity or the quality of something.

/// (3) The use of hiragana and katakana for onomatopoeia
/// While it is common to use katakana for sound onomatopoeia, onomatopoeia of manner and description are often written in hiragana, like the word きちん “properly” (manner)
/// The rules governing the use of katakana and hiragana for sound, manner, and descriptive onomatopoeia are not rigid, however. Variations in the use of these two kana in expressing onomatopoeia in writing may be observed.

/// The quotative particle と is necessary when the onomatopoeic word has no repeated elements.

あの人はいつもきちんと話します。//He always speaks properly.
この服はぼろぼろです。//This outfit is very old.

/// (4) Examples of different onomatopoeia
/// # Examples of sound onomatopoeiaa cat meowing
/// ワンワン a dog barking, ニャーニャー a cat meowing, ザーザー the sound of heavy rain, シトシト the sound of quiet rain, ペラペラ the sound of a foreign language spoken fluently, ガヤガヤ the noise made by a crowd of people

僕の犬は外でワンワン（と）吠えています。//My dog is barking outside.
あの人は日本語をペラペラ（と）話します。//That person speaks Japanese fluently.

/// # Examples of manner onomatopoeia
/// そ（う）quietly; soundlessly, じろじろ（ジロジロ）staring

/// When the onomatopoeia そ（う） is combined with the particle と, the small つ is needed, forming either そうっと or そっと.

彼は部屋にぞうっと入ってきました。//He entered the room quietly.
彼女は僕をじろじろ（と）見ました。//She stared at me.

/// # Examples of descriptive onomatopoeia
/// ぼろぼろ（ボロボロ）very old, ぴかぴか（ピカピカ）very shiny
/// In addition to being used in the predicate, descriptive onomatopoeia may be used to modify nouns

あのボロボロの服は私のです。//That old outfit is mine.
あの人はいつもピカピカの車を運転します。//That person always drives a shiny car.

/// # Descriptive onomatopoeia with する（します）
/// Descriptive verbs may be created by adding する（します） to onomatopoeia.
/// どきどきする “to be nervous” （どきどき is the sound of someone’s heart pounding）
/// わくわくする “to be excited” （わくわく describes the feeling of being excited）
/// おろおろする “to be confused, be lost” （おろおろ describes the feeling of being lost）
/// めそめそする “to be sad” （めそめそ describes someone being weepy）

試験の前はいつもどきどきします。//I always get nervous before examinations.

/// 3: Focus on Person or Situation
/// (1) Person vs. situation
/// In any language, there are innumerable ways to express an event.
/// The two broad categories are person-focused expressions and situation-focused expressions.
/// In person-focused expressions, “who will do/does/did something” is explicitly stated.
/// In situation-focused expressions, by contrast, the event is expressed without explicitly indicating “who will do/does/did something.” 
/// For instance, if someone spills some milk, the person-focused expression would be “I spilled the milk” while the situation-focused expression might be “The milk spilled.”

/// Within the context of Japanese culture, in some cases it is preferable to use situation-focused expressions because they are more indirect than person-focused expressions.

/// する（します） for the person-focused and なる（なります） for the situation-focused.

/// (2) The verb する（します）
/// # する（します） for making a choice or decision
/// The verb する（します） may be used to talk about making a choice or decision.
/// In this case, the particle に is used for the thing the speaker will choose (decide) or has chosen (decided).
/// Chosen things are expressed adverbially.

（あなたは）何にしますか。//What will you have?
（私は）寿司にします。//I’ll have sushi.

僕は専攻を日本語にしました。//I chose Japanese as my major.

/// # する（します） for making A into B
/// This one expresses changing the function of a certain thing into another, or changing from one state to another.
/// Changed functions or states are expressed adverbially.

試験をもっと易しくしました。//I made the exam easier.
教室をきれいにしましょう。//Let’s make the classroom beautiful.
この本をこのクラスの教科書にします。//I have selected this book as the textbook for this class.

/// (3) The verb なる（なります）
/// the verb なる（なります） is used for situation-focused expressions.
/// The verb なる（なります） expresses a change of situation.
/// The situation that will be or has been changed into is expressed adverbially.

/// # When a change is expressed with an adjective or a nominal element

外は寒くなりました。//It’s gotten cold outside.
クリスさんは元気になりました。//Kurisu-san has gotten healthy.
メアリーさんは先生になります。//Mary is going to be a teacher.
あの学生は日本語がペラペラになりました。//That student has become very fluent in Japanese.

/// # When a change is expressed with a verb
/// When a verb is used to express a change, the following structure should be used.
/// The verb must be in the plain form, and ように must be added before なる（なります）.

去年は漢字が読めませんでしたが、今年、読めるようになりました。//I could not read kanji last year, but this year, I’m able to read it.
うちの子は勉強するようになりました。//Our child studies now.

/// (4) Transitive-intransitive pairs of verbs
/// # What are transitive-intransitive verb pairs?
/// 開ける（あけます）open something <-> 開く（あきます）something opens
/// 閉める（しめます）close something <-> 閉まる（しまります）something closes
/// 始める（はじめます）begin something <-> 始まる（はじまります）something begins
/// 終える（おえます）finish something <-> 終わる（おわります）something ends

/// Transitive verbs are used for person-focused sentences, while the intransitive verbs are used for situation-focused sentences.
/// In the following example of a transitive sentence, the topic is the person who opens the store, while the topic of the intransitive sentence is the store.

毎朝、私は店を九時に開けます。//I open the store at 9 o’clock every morning.
毎朝、この店は九時に開きます。//This store opens at 9:00 every morning.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 4: Counters
/// (1) Years

/// This counter cannot be used for age, but it can be used to indicate a specific calendar year or a duration of years, as in “I was in Japan for three years.”

今年は何年ですか。//What year is it this year?
今年は２００９年です。//This year is the year 2009.

/// The Western calendar is referred to as 西暦（せいれき）. To avoid confusion in situations where the year may be ambiguous, 西暦（せいれき）２００９年, which means “the year 2009 in the Western calendar,” may be used.
/// The Japanese calendar years are referred to by the year of the current emperor’s reign, the whole of which is referred to as 時代（じだい） “era.”

/// with the counter 日（か・にち）, may be used both to name a specific date (such as “April 3rd”), and to describe the duration of time in days (such as “three days”). The only exception is when talking about something that lasts one day:
/// 一日（ついたち） means only “the first day of the month.”
/// 一日（いちにち） means “for one day” or “all day long.”

/// The order of mentioning a date must be from the bigger time unit to the smaller. Sometimes, people connect these times with the particle の, although it is more common to say dates without の.

/// # Asking “how old are you?”
/// To ask someone’s age, either 何才（なんさい） or いくつ may be used, but いくつ is normally used for asking children their age.

妹さんは何才ですか。//How old is your sister?
十八です。//She’s 18 years old.

/// (5) Durational time
/// The counters for specific time and for durational time may be different.
/// The endings, 時（じ）, 曜日 （ようび）, and 月（がつ）, are only for specific time.

/// # Specific vs. durational counters
/// The counters for minutes, days, and years cover both the specific and durational time.
/// For these counters, 間（かん）, which means “interval,” may be added to these counters to indicate the duration, but its use is optional:

/// Specific Time:
/// Minute 分（ふん・ぷん）
/// Day 日（か・にち）

カンバセーション。

/// (1) Giving compliments

ナースロボさん、この頃、随分、日本語が上手になりましたねえ。//Naasurobo-san, your Japanese has gotten much better lately!
いえいえ、まだまだです。//Oh, no. I still have a long way to go.

/// # この頃（ごろ）
/// This time adverb means “these days” or “recently.”

/// # 日本語（にほんご）が上手（じょうず）になりましたねえ
/// Literally this sentence means something like “you have become skillful with Japanese.”
/// However, the sentence does not imply that the speaker thought that the addressee’s Japanese was bad before, so such a literal translation might cause some misunderstanding.
/// Another commonly misunderstood sentence is the following, often used with young women: とてもきれいになりましたねえ, [literal translation] “You have become very pretty.” Once again, this sentence does not imply that the addressee was ugly earlier. These comments should be interpreted only as compliments.

/// まだ is an adverb meaning “not yet.”
/// By repeating まだ twice, the speaker emphasizes the imperfection of the skill of speaking Japanese.
/// When given a compliment, it is better, culturally, to give a humble response such as いえいえ、まだまだです, meaning “I still have a long way to go” than to agree to the compliment.

/// When used with other predicates, な is dropped.
/// Use the plain form before ~んです.

これは高いんです。//Let me tell you, this is expensive.
明日、日本に行くんです。//You may not know this, but the truth is I am going to Japan.

/// # そうなんですか
/// A speaker uses そう with なんですか to acknowledge what he or she has just heard, usually regarding some unexpected information.
/// ~（な）んですか is used to confirm the speaker’s understanding of certain circumstances or facts.

先生が怖いんですか。//Am I right in interpreting that you are afraid of the teacher?
明日も勉強するんですか。//Are you saying that you are studying again tomorrow?

/// おめでとうございます (ございます may be omitted in a less formal setting) is used to congratulate a person on many different occasions (a birthday, anniversary, graduation, or a positive achievement, among others).
