/// 1: Adverbial Clauses
/// (1) The concept of adverbial clauses
/// Two types of adverbial clauses were introduced. 
/// The first type uses the conjunction から to give a reason for something.
/// The second type indicates a time condition by using conjunctions 時（とき）, 前（まえ）, and 後（あと）.

/// (2) Adverbial clauses with the causal conjunction から
/// the cause or reason for a certain consequence may be expressed in a dependent clause joined by the conjunction から.

どうして、昨日、授業を休みましたか。//Why were you absent from class yesterday?
昨日、私は、母が病気だったから、授業を休みました。//I didn’t go to class yesterday because my mother was sick.

/// There are a few important points to remember for these constructions:
/// - Of the three interrogative pronouns, なぜ is the most formal, followed by どうして, and then なん で, the most colloquial.
/// - The predicate form before から is normally in the plain form, although the polite form may be used in very polite speech.
/// - The main clause in the response may be abbreviated by だ（or です） in conversation.
/// - When the topics in the dependent and independent clauses are not the same, use が for the topic in the dependent clause and は for the independent clause.

/// In fact, there are a few more dependent clauses that express causes and reasons.
/// It may be useful, at this point, to know that the clausal conjunction ので may also be used to connect the cause-dependent clause and the main clause.

昨日、私は病気だったので、授業を休みました。//I was sick yesterday, so I didn’t go to class.

/// In most cases, から and ので are interchangeable, but there are some differences;

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 2: Temporal Adverbial Clauses
/// (1) Temporal adverbial clauses joined by 時（とき）
/// a time condition may be expressed by an adverbial clause joined by the conjunction 時（とき）.

/// # Predicate aspectual forms before the conjunction 時（とき）
/// The following example uses the sentential conjunction その時（とき）:

明日、私は森さんに会います。ぞの時に、私達は日本語で話します。//I’ll meet Mori-san tomorrow. At that time, we’ll speak in Japanese.

/// The two sentences above may be changed into a complex sentence by using 時（とき） as the clausal conjunction

明日、私が森さんに会った時に、私は日本語で話します。//When I meet Mori-san tomorrow, we’ll speak in Japanese.

/// In the sentence above, the verb is in the perfective form, 会（あ）った, despite the fact that the speaker has not met Mori-san yet, because the speaker intends to speak to Mori-san after the act of meeting has taken place.
/// Remember, the perfective form indicates only the completion of an event, not the past tense.

/// # Stative predicates in the adverbial clauses
/// When the predicate in an adverbial clause is stative in nature, its form does not change, regardless of the form in the main clause.

寒い時、コートを着ます。//I wear a coat when it’s cold.
寒い時、コートを着ました。//I wore a coat when it was cold.

/// # Aspectual forms in adverbial clauses
/// The aspectual forms of movement verbs illustrate the imperfective and perfective aspects clearly, regardless of the time of the event. In the examples below, imagine a situation that includes the following two events:
/// (1) going to Japan from America; and (2) buying a dictionary.

/// In all cases, the aspectual form of the predicate in the main clause is what indicates whether both events have taken place or not.
/// There are four possible situations:

日本に行く時、辞書を買います。//I will buy a dictionary before going to Japan.
日本に行った時、辞書を買います。//I will buy a dictionary in Japan after I arrive there.
日本に行く時、辞書を買いました。//I bought a dictionary before I arrived in Japan.
日本に行った時、辞書を買いました。//I bought a dictionary in Japan after I arrived there.

/// (2) Temporal adverbial clauses joined by 前（まえ）
/// the plain positive imperfective must be used before 前（まえ）に, as the time condition indicates that the action in the adverbial clause is incomplete when the action in the main clause takes or has taken place.
/// This is true regardless of the time the sentence expresses in the main predicate.

ルームメートが１０時に寝る前に、私はテレビを見ます。//I’ll watch TV before my roommate goes to bed at 10:00.
ルームメートが１０時に寝る前に、私はテレビを見ました。//I watched TV before my roommate went to bed at 10:00.

/// (3) Temporal adverbial clauses joined by 後（あと）
/// Similarly, the plain positive perfective form must be used before 後（あと）で, as the adverbial clause indicates an action completed before the action in the main clause takes or has taken place.
/// This is true regardless of the time of the sentence shows in the main predicate.

ルームメートが１０時に寝た後で、私はテレビを見ます。//I’ll watch TV after my roommate goes to bed at 10:00.
ルームメートが１０時に寝た後で、私はテレビを見ました。//I watched TV after my roommate went to bed at 10:00.

/// (4) Use of 前（まえ） and 後（あと） with numbers
/// 前（まえ）and 後（あと）can be used immediately after numbers that indicate time.

三年前に日本に行きました。//I went to Japan three years ago.
三年後で日本に行きました。//I went to Japan three years later.
三年後に日本に行きました。//I went to Japan three years later.

/// 三年後 may be pronounced either さんねんあと or さんねんご.
/// The pronunciation of the kanji 後 depends on whether the particle に or で is used.
/// If で is used, the phrase is pronounced さんねんあと; if に is used, it is pronounced さんねんご.
/// The particle に is optional after 三年前 and 三年後（さ んねんご）, but で must follow 三年後（さんねんあと）.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 3: Situational Adverbial Clauses Joined by the たら-forms
/// (1) たら-forms
/// Adverbial clauses that indicate conditions of time are often expressed in English with “when” and “if.”
/// It is important for the students not to try to correlate the words “when” and “if” directly to specific structures in Japanese.
/// Rather, it is more important to understand the basic meanings that these Japanese structures express.
/// There are quite a few adverbial clauses that express time-related conditions.
/// In this section, one such adverbial clause will be introduced.
/// This is called the たら adverbial clause because its predicate ends with ~たら.

/// For now, the 時（とき）and たら adverbial clauses are distinguished as follows:
/// the condition expressed in the 時（とき） adverbial clause is temporal (“at the time when”), while the condition in the たら adverbial clause is situational (“if and when the situation is such-and-such”).

/// The rules to derive the たら-forms are quite simple: just add ~ら to the ending of the perfective form ~た or ~だ.
/// Verbal: Perfective form + ら
/// Adjectival: ~い → ~かったら
/// Nominal (copula): だ → だったら
/// Negative predicate: ~ない → ~なかったら

/// (2) When the predicate of the main clause is in the imperfective form
/// The たら-form can be used to express a situational condition under which a certain outcome will occur.
/// In this case, the main clause is always in the imperfective form.

日本に行ったら、日本語が上手に成ると思います。//If you go to Japan, I believe your Japanese will improve.
車がもっと安かったら、買います。//If cars were cheaper, I would buy one.
あの部屋が静かだったら、あそこで勉強します。//If that room is quiet, I will study there.

/// (3) When the predicate of the main clause is in the perfective form
/// The たら-form in the adverbial clause can also indicate circumstances under which an unexpected event occurred.
/// In this case, the predicate form in the main clause is always perfective.

家に帰ったら、母が来ていました。//To my surprise, when I returned home, my mother was there.
クラスに行ったら、だれもいませんでした。//To my surprise, when I went to class, no one was there.

/// (4) Difference between the たら-adverbial and the とき-adverbial
/// The main difference between sentences with adverbial clauses using 時（とき）and those using ~たら is that with 時（とき）, the focus of the sentence is when the event expressed in the main clause happened or will happen.
/// With ~たら, on the other hand, sentence focuses on what happened or will happen under the situation expressed in the ~たら clause.

/// Compare the two responses to the following question:

いつ聞きましょうか。//When shall we ask him?

林さんが来た時に、聞きましょう。//Let’s ask Hayashi-san when he gets here.
林さんが来たら、聞きましょう。//If Hayashi-san comes, let’s ask him.

/// The difference between the adverbial clauses above is that,
/// with the 時（とき）-adverbial, the speaker knows that Hayashi-san will arrive at some point;
/// with the たら-adverbial, Hayashi-san’s arrival is uncertain.

/// When the speaker is not certain that the conditions given will be met, the use of the たら-adverbial is more appropriate than the 時（とき）-adverbial.

林さんが来たら、どうしましょうか。//What should we do if Hayashi-san comes here?

/// 時（とき）-adverbial clauses may not be used when the consequence expressed in the main clause is not controllable.
/// 困（こま）る means “to be in trouble.”

林さんが来たら、困ります。//I’ll be in trouble if Hayashi-san comes here.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 4: Situational Adverbial Clauses Joined by と
/// Another example of situational adverbial clauses is a construction in which the adverbial and main clauses are joined by the conditional conjunction と.
/// In this construction, the predicate preceding the conjunction と must be in the imperfective form.

/// (1) When the predicate of the main clause is in the imperfective form
/// # Natural consequences
/// When the predicate of the main clause is in the imperfective form, the sentence expresses the natural consequence of the situation described in the adverbial clause.
/// In these cases, the consequence is something that the speaker has no control over; it occurs naturally.

春に成ると、暖かく成ります。//Once spring comes, it will get warmer.
もっと漢字を勉強すると、日本語は易しく成ります。//Once you study more kanji, Japanese will get easier.

/// # Habitual consequences
/// “Natural consequences” and “habitual consequences” are related,
/// but habitual consequences usually concern personal and controllable events rather than a natural, uncontrollable outcome.

/// This construction indicates that every time the event described in the adverbial clause occurs, the speaker or the topic does what is expressed in the main clause.

日本に行くと、井上さんに会います。//Whenever I go to Japan, I see Inoue-san.
クラスが終わると、いつも図書館で宿題をします。//After class, I always do my homework in the library.

/// (2) When the predicate of the main clause is in the perfective form
/// When the predicate of the main clause is in the perfective form in this construction, it expresses an event occurring immediately after the situation described in the adverbial clause.
/// The adverb す ぐ（に） “immediately” often accompanies the main clause.

家に帰ると、友達から電話がありました。//As soon as I returned home, I got a phone call from a friend.
朝ご飯を食べると、すぐ大学に行きました。//As soon as I ate breakfast, I went to college.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 5: Representative Expressions
/// the particle や is used to indicate that items in addition to those mentioned are included in the sentence.
/// For instance, the phrase 本やペン indicates that the speaker is implying that there are more than just books and pens.
/// However,や may not be used to list predicates.

/// To list predicates, the speaker must use the たり-form (also called the representative form), with the verb する used in the final position of the sentence.
/// This is called the representative form because it is used when the speaker chooses to mention a few representative events out of many that could be listed.

/// As with the て-form, the たり-form alone does not make a meaningful grammatical sentence.
/// In the most common structure, the actions or the descriptions made with the たり-form must be concluded with the verb する.
/// The meaning of the sentence with the representative form, however, will differ depending upon the type of the predicate.

/// (1) たり-formation (representative form)
/// To create the representative form, add り to the perfective form of the predicate.

/// (2) Verbal predicates
/// The following exchange shows how ~たり is used in conversation:

昨日、何をしましたか。//What did you do yesterday?
昨日、料理したり、映画に行ったりしました。//I cooked, and went to a movie—things like that.

/// The たり-form is used twice within the response above.
/// It is common, though not obligatory, to use the たり-form twice.
/// Sometimes it is only used once; at other times, it may be used more than twice.

/// Note that the たり-form, like the conjunctive form, does not convey aspect.
/// Aspect is always indicated by the final verb, する. In the example above, the final verb is in the perfective form.
/// In the following examples, the main clauses are in the imperfective form and in the command construction.

昨日、料理したり、映画に行ったりします。//Tomorrow I will cook, and go to the movies, and do other things like that.
土曜日には、料理したり、映画に行ったりしてください。//Please cook, and go to the movies, and do other things like that on Saturday.

/// (3) Adjectival predicates
/// Since the primary function of adjectives is to describe, the たり-forms of adjectives with the verb する in a sentence are used to give different descriptions for different times.

日本語のテストは難しかったり、易しかったりします。//Sometimes Japanese exams are difficult and sometimes they’re easy.
この店のケーキは美味しかったり、美味しくなかったりです。//Cakes at this store sometimes taste great, but sometimes they’re not so good.

/// The copula in the second sentence functions to abbreviate the predicate with する.
/// This construction is commonly used.

/// When different descriptions apply to different things or people, they do not necessarily refer to different times:

この学校の先生は優しかったり、優しくなかったりします。//Some teachers at this school are lenient and some are not.

/// (4) Nominal predicates
/// The function of the たり-form of the copula is the same as that of the adjective.
/// The following examples illustrate the different aspects of the final verb する.

今年の日本語のテストの日は月曜日だったり火曜日だったりしています。//The day of this year’s Japanese tests has sometimes been Monday and sometimes Tuesday.
今年の日本語のテストの日は月曜日だったり火曜日だったりします。//The day of this year’s Japanese tests is sometimes Monday and sometimes Tuesday.


/// The difference between しています and します at the end of the above two sentences is aspectual.
/// しています implies the current situation while します implies a general description of the testing situation.

/// The example below is somewhat ambiguous:

日本語の先生はアメリカ人の先生だったり日本人の先生だったりです。//Some of the Japanese teachers are American, and some are Japanese.

/// Though the translation above is the most likely interpretation, this sentence could also be read as “Sometimes an American teacher comes to the Japanese class, and at other times it’s a Japanese teacher.”
/// The meaning in such cases depends on the context.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 6: Conjunctions
/// (1) Clausal conjunction し
/// The conjunction し is used between two independent clauses.
/// The function of this conjunction is to add information, much like そして, except that it is used between clauses rather than sentences.

あの人は、頭もいいし、顔もきれいですね。//That person is not only smart, but she also has a very pretty face.

/// Like けれども, the form of the first clause can be either in the plain form or the polite form when the predicate of the second clause is in the polite form.

あの人は、頭もいいし、顔もきれいだし、私は大好きです。//I like her a lot because she is smart and pretty.
あの人は、頭もいいですし、顔もきれいですし、私は大好きです。//I like her a lot because she is smart and pretty.

/// As the sentences above indicate, し may be used as a conjunction after an adverbial clause giving the reason for the statement made in the main clause.

/// (2) Sentential conjunction その上（うえ）
/// The conjunction その上（うえ） is sentential rather than clausal.
/// The second sentence gives additional information.

あの人は本当に頭がいいです。その上、顔もきれいです。//That person is really smart. On top of that, she’s pretty, too.

/// (3) Sentential conjunctions すると and そ（う）したら
/// と and ~たら used in sentences in this chapter may also be used as independent sentential conjunctions in the forms すると and そ（う）したら.
/// When they are used to join sentences, these conjunctions function the same as と and ~たら used for adverbial clauses.

/// Recall that when と is used between an adverbial clause and the main clause with a perfective predicate, the event in the main clause is immediate.

部屋に入った。すると、電話が鳴った。//I entered the room. Immediately after that, the phone rang.

/// ~たら in the adverbial clause expresses that the event indicated in the main clause is unexpected.
/// In this case, the predicate in the main clause must be in the perfective form.
/// The sentential conjunction そしたら expresses this nuance.
/// そしたら is used more like a clause, meaning something like “after doing that, to my surprise...”

病気で学校を休んだ。そしたら、先生から電話があった。//I was sick, so I didn’t go to school. My teacher surprised me by calling me on the phone because I was absent.
妹にケーキを上げた。そしたら、妹は泣いた。//I gave my sister a piece of cake. She surprised me by bursting into tears in response.

/// # More conjunctions
/// Other conjunctions may be necessary to express certain things;

カンバセーション。

/// (1) Giving a suggestion

さっきね、うちに帰ったら、姉から電話があったんですよ。明日、帰るって。//My sister suddenly called me when I got home. She said she’s coming home tomorrow.
へえ、何かあったんですか。//Really? Did something happen?
別にたいしたことないと思うんですけどね。//I don’t think it’s anything serious.
でも、もう一度、電話してあげたら、どうですか。//But maybe you should call her again, don’t you think?

/// # さっきね
/// The use of ね after a word or a phrase is a device to confirm that the addressee understands what is being said.
/// In conversation it is used often, even within the same sentence.

/// # 別（べつ）にたいしたことない
/// The adverb 別（べつ）に, which must accompany a negative predicate, means “not particularly.”

これは別に美味しくありません。//This is not especially tasty.

/// たいしたことない is an idiomatic phrase meaning “nothing serious” or “not a big deal.”

/// # 電話（でんわ）してあげる
/// あげる, one of the verbs of giving, is combined with the verb 電話（でんわ）する to mean, in the above context, “call your sister to see if everything is all right.” This structure will be covered in detail in the next chapter.

/// # ~たらどうですか
/// This construction is used to make a suggestion.

友達と一緒に勉強したら、どうですか。//Why don’t you study with a friend?

/// (2) Not feeling well

昨日、姉に電話したら、ちょっと具合が悪いから、帰りたいって。//When I called my sister yesterday, she said she wanted to come home because she wasn’t feeling well.
やっぱり。何でもないと、いいですね。//I thought so. I hope it’s nothing serious.

/// # 具合（ぐあい）が悪（わる）い
/// 具合（ぐあい） is a noun that means “condition” or “situation.”
/// This noun can be used for a thing (such as a machine) or a person.
/// When it is used for a person, it usually refers to their health.
/// Therefore, 具合（ぐあい）が悪（わる）い, when discussing a person, means they are “not feeling well” or are “feeling sick.”

/// # 何（なん）でもない
/// This phrase means “nothing serious.”

/// といいです expresses the speaker’s wish for a certain situation.

/// (3) I’m sorry to do this, but…

もう、行く準備できた？//Are you ready to go?
わるいけど、もうちょっとだけ待ってくれない？//Sorry, but can you wait for me a little longer?
間に会わないと、困るんです。しかられますから。//I don’t want to be late—I’ll really be in trouble.
じゃ、先に行ってて。//OK, then go ahead.
じゃ、申し訳ないけど、さきに行ってるね。//Sorry, but I think I should go now.

/// # わるいけど
/// This expression can be used when the speaker feels guilty about asking a favor of the addressee.
/// It means “I’m really sorry, but...”

/// # 待（ま）ってくれない？
/// This is a casual way of asking 待ってくださいませんか.

/// # と困（こま）る
/// This expression is used to refer to an undesirable situation, the exact nature of which is, to the speaker, somewhat uncertain.

/// 先生が日本人だと困るんですが・・・
/// “We won’t be happy if the teacher is Japanese.”
/// [Literally, “If the teacher is Japanese, we’ll be in trouble.”]

/// しかられる is the passive verb of the base verb 叱（しか）る “to scold.” See Stages 1–9 and 2–4 for further explanation of passive forms.

/// # 先（さき）に行く
/// 先（さき）に is a time adverb meaning “beforehand.”
/// Therefore, 先（さき）に行く means “to go before another person.”
/// 行ってて here is the same as 行っていて.

/// # 申（もう）し訳（わけ）ないけど
/// 申（もう）し訳（わけ）ないけど is a more polite version of わるいけど.
/// Even in a casual conversation, a speaker can use 申（もう）し訳（わけ）ないけど, an expression equivalent to “I am truly sorry.”
/// The use of a more humble expression conveys the depth of the speaker’s regret.
/// The polite predicate ありません instead of ない may also be used to make the expression more polite: 申（もう）し訳（わけ）ありませんが.
/// The conjunction が is more formal than the colloquial けど.
