stage ２，１。
/// Stage 2-1 Conjunctive Forms and Their Uses
/// 1: The Continuous Aspect
/// (1) Conjunctive forms
/// the rules for the conjunctive forms are exactly the same as those for the plain positive perfective forms except for the final syllable.
/// Instead of ending the form with た or だ, as in the plain positive perfectives, the conjunctive forms end in て or で.

/// (2) The continuous aspect of repeatable (punctual) verbs
/// The て-form and the verb いる together express the continuous aspect of an action, event, or state.
/// whether the continuous meaning is one of action or state depends on the type of verb.

/// Verbs such as “to eat” and “to study” denote actions that one can repeat or do continuously.
/// For these verbs, the construction with ~て and いる indicates repeated actions.
/// This construction therefore has two different meanings, as indicated below:

日本語を勉強しています。//I am currently studying Japanese.
/// or “I have been studying Japanese for some time.”

/// - The continuous aspect of non-action verbs
/// Some stative verbs, such as some semi-transitive verbs, do not use the ~ている construction.
/// These verbs are stative in meaning, and thus are already continuous in nature.

私はいい辞書がいります。//I need a good dictionary.
私は日本語が話せます。//I am able to speak Japanese.

/// ~ている may not be used to express ideas above, as shown in the following incorrect sentences:

/// - When a verb has more than one meaning
/// A single word often has multiple meanings. One such example is the verb 分（わ）かる.
/// The following sentence indicates that the topic has a specific ability; the verb therefore has a stative meaning.

私は日本語が分かります。//I understand Japanese.
//// [ = I have the ability to understand Japanese.]

/// The idea in the sentence above cannot be expressed with ~ている, because having the ability to do something refers to a state or condition, rather than an action or an event.

/// The verb 分（わ）かる has a second meaning, however: “to figure something out.”
/// This verb may also be used to talk about having obtained knowledge about a specific thing or person.
/// This meaning indicates a process, rather than a state. When the verb carries this meaning, the ~ている construction can be used.

あの人のことはよく分かっています。//I have heard a lot about that person, and I now have a good understanding of him.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (3) The continuous aspect of non-repeatable (punctual) verbs
/// Verbs such as the second meaning of 分（わ）かる “to figure something out” and 起（お）きる “to get up” denote a one-time, non-repeatable action.
/// This type of verb is sometimes termed a “punctual verb.”
/// The て-form of these verbs, when used with いる, indicates that the action has been completed, and the topic is currently in the state of maintaining the completed action.

起きています。//I am up.

// /The sentence above does not refer to the process of getting up, but rather the state of being awake after the action of getting up has been completed.
/// With a punctual verb such as 起（お）きる, Japanese speakers normally use either the positive imperfective to say “I will get up soon,” or use ~ている to say “I am up already.”
/// They will seldom utter a sentence that is equivalent to “I am in the process of getting up.”

/// - The verb 知（し）る
/// The verb 知（し）る, often translated as “to know,” and the verb 分（わ）かる, translated as “to understand,” are similar in meaning.
/// 知（し）る implies obtaining information, while 分（わ）かる implies having an ability to figure things out, and also refers to the process of figuring things out.

/// The ~ている construction with the verb 知（し）る is used to talk about the possession of knowledge.

私はあの人の名前を知っています。//I know that person’s name.

/// the ~ている construction cannot be used as the negative of 知（し）っている
/// To say that a person does not possess knowledge of something, the imperfective negative is used, rather than the negative of the ~ている construction:

私はあの人の名前を知りません。//I don’t know that person’s name.

/// When asking whether a person possesses a certain piece of information, the negative 知（し）りませ んか is used as often as the positive 知（し）っていますか.

あの人の電話番号を知りませんか。//Do you know that person’s phone number?
あの人の電話番号を知っていますか。//Do you know that person’s phone number?

/// - 持（も）つ vs. ある
/// Both 持（も）つ and ある are normally translated into English as the verb “to have.”
/// One significant difference between the two is that 持（も）つ implies that the topic is physically holding something; ある does not include this implication.
/// For instance, if someone is carrying a bag, the verb 持（も）つ must be used, rather than ある:

あの人は何を持っていますか。//What does that person have?
鞄を持っています。//He has a bag.

/// To talk about possession of an abstract item at a specific time, ある is normally used.

今日、僕は時間がたくさんあります。//I have a lot of time today.

/// When talking about possessing abstract things such as 考（かんが）え “thoughts” or “ideas” at a non-specific time, 持（も）つ may also be used:

あの人はいい考えをたくさん持っています。//He has a lot of good ideas.

/// Both ある and 持（も）つ may be used to talk about possession of things, concepts, or ideas rather than physically carrying something:

時雨さんはお金をたくさん持っています。//Shigure-san has possesses a lot of money.
時雨さんはお金がたくさんあります。//Shigure-san has a lot of money.
時雨さんの家はお金がたくさんあります。//The Shigure estate has a lot of money.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (4) The continuous aspect of directional verbs
/// The following sentence contains a directional verb in the ~ている aspect.

パクさんは日本に行っています。//Park-san has gone to Japan.

/// It means that the act of going to Japan has been completed

加藤さんはここに来ています。//Kato-san has arrived.
父は家に帰っています。//My father has come home.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 2: Joining Predicates
/// (1) Joining two predicates
/// the conjunctive form is used to join clauses.

/// - Non-action (stative) predicates

私はクリスで、日本語の学生です。//I’m Kurisu, a student of Japanese.
中国は大きくて、遠いです。//China is both large and far away.
あの人は英語も話せて、漢字も読めます。//That person can speak English, and can read kanji too.

/// - Action verbs
/// the order of actions is implied.
/// the first action mentioned is understood as being completed before the action mentioned next begins.
/// the aspect of the final verb determines the aspect of all the actions in the sentence.
/// This is because the conjunctive form lacks aspectual forms.

私は勉強して、運動します。//I will study and then exercise.
私は勉強して、運動しました。//I studied and then exercised.

/// When two clauses have different topics, however, the order of actions is not implicit, as it would be with a single topic:

昨日、僕は勉強して、時雨さんは運動しました。//I studied, but Shigure-san exercised yesterday.

/// - Color terms and how to join them
/// most primary colors have both adjectival and nominal forms.
/// For example, 赤（あか）, a noun, and 赤（あか）い, an adjective, are both words for “red.” Similarly, the adjectives 黒（くろ）い “black,” 青（あお）い “blue,” and 白（しろ）い “white” have the nominal forms 黒（くろ）, 青（あお）, and 白（しろ） respectively.

/// When a nominal color term modifies a noun, the particle の must be used between the two nouns, with the color term being the first element.
/// の is required because the color terms are nouns rather than adjectives.
/// 赤のかばん  黒のペン

/// Some color terms, such as 緑（みどり） and 緑色（みどりいろ）, which both mean “green,” do not have the adjectival options. These words are nouns.

/// Japanese color terms sometimes differ from those in English regarding the range of color that each term refers to on the color spectrum.
/// For instance, the green of a traffic light in Japan is referred to as 青（あお） “blue,” even though it is a greenish color. This is because the term 青（あお） covers a wider range of colors than the English term “blue.”

/// When two descriptive predicates are applied to a single topic, it is understood that each of the predicates describes the topic completely.

この本は小さくて、高いです。//This is a small, expensive book.

/// When using more than one color term to describe an item, the nominal forms of the color terms with the conjunction と must be used.

私の鞄は赤と黒です。//My bag is black and red.

/// When two different color terms are used to describe two different topics in a single sentence, however, the conjunctive construction may be used.
/// Each color describes only one topic.

あの鞄は赤くて、この鞄は黒いです。//That bag is red, and this bag is black.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (2) When the first nominal or adjectival predicate is negative
/// Since all negative plain forms end with ~い (from ~ない), all negatives are conjugated according to the rules for adjectives.
/// The following examples use the conjunctive forms of negative nominal and adjectival predicates to join other predicates:

私は日本人じゃなくて、中国人です。//I’m not Japanese, I’m Chinese.
この寿司は美味しくなくて、高いです。//This sushi doesn’t taste good, but it’s expensive.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (3) When the first verbal predicate is negative -> ["~ないで, ..."]
/// When the initial predicate is a negative verbal predicate, it is joined differently to the predicate that follows.
/// The meaning of the sentence is also different.
/// In this case, the combination of the plain negative imperfective of a verb and the conjunctive of the copula で is used to join the negative verbal predicate to a second predicate.

/// The meaning of the sentence is that the action described in the second predicate is, or will be, begun without completing the action described in the first predicate.

朝ご飯を食べないで、学校に行きました。//I went to school without eating breakfast first.
勉強しないで、試験を受けました。//I took an exam without studying first.

/// When the conjunctive form of a negative imperfective verb is used, the clause takes on a causal meaning.
/// The independent clause indicates naturally occurring consequences such as 困（こま）る “feel troubled; feel worried,” as seen below:

この宿題が分からないて、困っています。//I’m worried because I don’t understand this assignment.

/// two or more different types of predicates (e.g. nominal and adjectival predicates) may be joined by the conjunctive form to make a single sentence.
/// However, in this case, action and non-action predicates may not be joined by the conjunctive form to make a single sentence, unless the sentence expresses a cause-consequence relation.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (4) Joining predicates with ~てから
/// - The sentential conjunction それから
/// adds the meaning of “from that point on,” or “after completing that action.”

私は朝ご飯を食べてから、走りました。//After eating breakfast, I went running.
