stage ２，８。
/// Stage 2-8 も and は

/// 1: ても-Adverbials
/// Overriding particles も and は are used in various constructions to add different meanings to phrases, clauses, and sentences.
/// There are fixed and non-fixed expressions with these phrases

/// (1) Expressing permission with ~てもいい
/// Spoken as a statement, this phrase grants the addressee permission to do something.
/// In question form, it is a way of asking permission.

/// The following summary illustrates the use of this phrase with different predicate types.

/// # Positive adverbials

飲み物は水でもいいですか。//Is water OK for a drink?
晩ご飯は少し早くてもいいですか。//Is it all right if we have dinner a little early?
宿題は月曜日に出してもいいですか。//Is it all right if I submit my assignment on Monday?

/// # Negative adverbials

飲み物は水じゃなくてもいいですか。//Is it all right if the drink isn’t water?
晩ご飯は早くなくてもいいですか。//Is it all right if we don’t have dinner early?
宿題は月曜日に出さなくてもいいですか。//Is it all right if I don’t submit my assignment on Monday?
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (2) Expressing permission with ~てもかまわない
/// In place of いい in the above construction, かまわない “does not matter” may also be used.
/// The meaning is the same; the only difference is that phrases with いい sound more casual than those with かまわない.

子供は早くお腹がすくと思いますから、早くそちらに行かせてもかまいませんか。//I think the children will be hungry early; would it be all right for them to go there earlier?
月曜日に出してくださいと言われましたが、月曜日じゃなくてもかまいませんか。//I was told to submit it on Monday, but would it be all right not to do so?

/// # Combination of positive and negative adverbials
/// It is possible to include both positive and negative predicates in one sentence with ~てもいい and かまわない structures.

この薬は飲んでも、飲まなくてもいいですよ。//You can take this medicine or not; either way is fine.
この薬は飲んでも、飲まなくてもかまいませんよ。//You can take this medicine or not; either way is fine.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (3) Non-fixed use of the ても-adverbials
/// The ても-adverbials may also be used in a non-fixed way.
/// The ても-adverbial expresses a condition that would have been sufficient for the (desirable) expected outcome, but the actual consequence expressed in the main clause indicates that the expected (desired) outcome did not occur.
/// Because of this, the main clause is often in the negative.

リンさんが私に日本語で話してくれても、分かりませんでした。//Even though Lin-san spoke to me in Japanese, I still did not understand it.
三時間、待っても、あの人は来ませんでした。//Even though I waited for him for three hours, he didn’t show up.
そんなに野菜をたくさん食べても、すぐには元気になりませんよ。//Even though you’re eating lots of vegetables, you aren’t going to get better right away.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (4) Using the ても-adverbial twice (or more)
/// When the ても-adverbial is used twice or more in an adverbial clause,
/// the sentence indicates an undesirable outcome despite repeated efforts.

言っても、言っても、彼は分かりませんでした。//No matter how many times I told him, he didn’t understand.

/// The number of repetitions is not limited to any particular number, but too many repetitions will diminish the effect.

食べても、食べても、食べても、お腹がいっぱいになりませんでした。//No matter how much I ate, I didn’t get full.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (5) Interrogative pronouns with ~ても
/// When interrogative pronouns are used in a clause with ~ても,
/// it expresses that every possible option has been or will be tried, but an undesirable outcome resulted, or will result.

今日は、何を食べても、おいしくありません。//No matter what I eat today, it doesn’t taste good.
この問題は、だれに聞いても、分からないと言われました。//No matter who I asked about this problem, no one knew the answer.

/// Degrees of conditions are expressed with どんなに rather than どう.

どんなにお腹がすいていても、すしは食べられません。//No matter how hungry I am, I can’t eat sushi.

/// どう is used to indicate that different ways have been tried.

どう考えても、彼の意見には賛成できない。//No matter how I think about it, I still can’t agree with his opinion.

/// # Interrogative pronouns with counters
/// This structure emphasizes the number of times a certain thing was tried or will be tried only to meet an undesirable outcome.

何度、電話しても、あの人は電話に出ませんでした。//No matter how many times I called him, he didn’t answer the phone.
この漢字は何回、書いても、覚えられません。//No matter how many times I write this kanji, I just can’t memorize it.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 2: も in Phrases
/// (1) Indefinite amount
/// Indefinite amounts of things may be expressed by combining 何 {なん} with a counter (or いくつ for the ~つ counter) and the particle も or か.
/// The combination with も indicates a larger number (“several”) than the one with か (“a few”).

/// # 何 (with an appropriate counter) or いくつ and も

この本は何度も読みましたが、全然、分かりません。//I’ve read this book several times, but I don’t get it at all.
あの人に何日も滞在されて、とても困りました。//He inconvenienced us greatly by staying at our house for several days.

かばんをいくつか買ってみましたが、好きなかばんはありませんでした。//I bought a few bags, but I didn’t find one that I really liked.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (2) Number (with an appropriate counter) も
/// When も is added to a number, it expresses that the number mentioned is more than the speaker had expected:

母はトーストを三枚も食べてしまいました。//Mom went and ate three pieces of toast.
日本に四回も行ったことがあるんですか。//You mean you’ve been to Japan four times?

/// # Comparison between も and は
/// When は is used instead of も in the above sentences,
/// the phrases with the number indicate the least amount.

// These sentences below indicate that the speaker does not know the exact number, but the number that is given is the least possible number.

母はトーストを三枚は食べたと思います。//I think Mom ate at least three pieces of toast.
あの人は日本に四回は行ったことがあると思いますよ。//I believe that person has been to Japan at least four times.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (3) 一 (with an appropriate counter) も
/// This combination with the negative predicate means “not even one.”

日本に行ったことがありますか。//Have you been to Japan?
いいえ、一度もありません。//No. Not even once.
本を買うつもりでしたが、一円も持っていませんでした。//I was going to buy a book, but I didn’t have a single yen on me.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (4) Interrogative pronoun でも
/// でも is added to interrogative pronouns to produce the following meanings:

/// なにも nothing,
/// なにか something,
/// なんでも anything

/// だれも no one,
/// だれか someone,
/// だれでも anyone

/// どこも nowhere,
/// どこか somewhere,
/// どこでも anywhere

/// どれも not one thing,
/// どれか one of the things,
/// どれでも any one of them

/// どちらも neither,
/// どちらか one of the two,
/// どちらでも both

/// （いつも） (always),
/// いつか sometime,
/// いつでも anytime

/// どうしても no matter how,
/// どうしてか for some reason,
/// どうしてでも by any means

/// # Fixed expression: interrogative pronoun with でもいい（かまわない）
/// Fixed expressions containing an interrogative pronoun with でもいい（かまわない）
/// indicate that any option available would be acceptable.

パーティーの日は、いつでもいいです。//Any day would do for us to have a party.
一緒に住むのはだれでもいいとは言えません。//I can’t say that I’d be able to live with just anyone.

/// # Non-fixed usages
/// An interrogative pronoun with でも refers to every possible thing, person, and so on, depending on the meaning the interrogative pronoun carries.
/// Such phrases can be used in a non-fixed way.

あの人は何でも食べます。//That person will eat anything.
あの人に言われたら、どこにでも行きます。//I’ll go anywhere that person tells me to.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 3: ては-Adverbials
/// Adverbial clauses with ~ては also have both fixed and non-fixed expressions.

/// (1) Expressing prohibition with ~てはいけない or ~てはだめ
/// Both of these fixed expressions indicate that the topicalized element is not acceptable.
/// だめ has a more colloquial tone than いけない.

この試験では、辞書を使ってはいけません。//You may not use a dictionary for this test.
お客さんに出すお茶は古くてはだめです。//You mustn’t serve old tea to guests.
学生に出す宿題は簡単な宿題ではいけません。//The homework you give to students shouldn’t be easy.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (2) Non-fixed ては-adverbials

そんなことを言っては、失礼です。//It’s rude to say such a thing.
そんなことを言うのは、失礼です。//Saying such a thing would be rude.

/// The difference between the two is that the first sentence with ~ては implies that the act of saying has taken place, while the second sentence does not.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (3) Expressing obligation with ~なくては
/// Obligation may be expressed by the following fixed structures: ~なくてはならない, ~なくてはいけない, and ~なくてはだめ.
/// The basic meaning of these phrases comes from the literal meaning, “if (something) did not happen, it would not do.”
/// From this meaning, the nuance of obligation comes through, as in “One must/should do/be such-and-such.”

/// The difference among the three options is that of formality:
/// the most formal is ~なくてはならない; then ~なくてはいけない; and ~なくてはだめ is colloquial.
/// The following example uses a verbal predicate:

すぐに行かなくてはだめです。//I’d better go soon.
/// or いけません・なりません
靴は日本製じゃなくてはいけません。//Shoes should be Japan-made.
/// or なりません・だめです
この部屋の机は新しくなくてはなりません。//The desk in this room should be new.
/// or いけません・だめです
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (4) Expressing obligation with ~なければ
/// Obligation may also be expressed by changing the above fixed structure with ~なくては to one with ~なければ and adding the same three options: ~なければはならない, ~なければいけない, and ~なければだめ.
/// The basic meaning of these phrases shares the similar literal meaning as ~なくては: that is, “if (something) did not happen, it would not do.”
/// This meaning is also communicates a sense of obligation, as in “One must/should do/be such-and-such.”

/// The difference among the three options is, again, formality:
/// the most formal is ~なければならない; then ~なければいけない; and ~なければだめ is colloquial.

/// For the sake of comparison, the following examples are identical to the ones above except for ~な ければ instead of ~なくては.
/// The examples below use all three predicates (verbal, nominal, and adjectival, in order):

すぐに行かなければだめです。//I’d better go soon.
/// or いけません・なりません
靴は日本製じゃなければいけません。//Shoes should be Japan-made.
/// or なりません・だめです
この部屋の机は新しくなければなりません。//The desk in this room should be new.
/// or いけません・だめです

/// # The difference between the two expressions of obligation
/// The difference between the two is small.
/// An obligation expressed with ~なければ sounds a little stronger and more formal than one expressed with ~なくては.

/// # Conditionals with ば
/// The fixed expression with ~なければ comes from the conditional predicate form, the ば-form, which will be introduced below.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 4: Conditional Adverbial Clauses with ~ば
/// Thus far, it has been explained that time and situational conditions are expressed with adverbial clauses joined by the conjunctions 時 {とき}, 前 {まえ}, 後 {あと}, or と.
/// The predicate form ~たら may also be used in the adverbial clause in this case.
/// Another adverbial clause that expresses situational conditions is joined by the so-called ば-form of the predicate.

/// (1) Creating the ば-formation
/// Nominal predicate       である → であれば
/// ex 日本人であれば
/// Adjectival predicate    い → ければ
/// ex たかければ, よければ
/// Verbal predicate        the last {u} to {e} and add ば
/// ex たべれば, はなせば, くれば

/// # である as the copula
/// is a more formal copula than だ. 

姉は医者だ。姉は医者である。//My older sister is a medical doctor.

/// The ば-form of the copula, であれば, is based only on である and not with だ.

/// (2) Using the ば-conditional
/// The ば-conditional is used only for an assumed situational condition, the realization of which the speaker is not so sure of.
/// That is, the condition stated in the ば-conditional may or may not be true.

夕食が和食であれば、私は行きません。//If Japanese food is on the menu for dinner, I’m not going.

/// A similar meaning can also be expressed with the たら-conditional.
/// The “uncertainty” of the condition in the ば-conditional is stronger than that in the たら-conditional, which causes the ば-conditional to sound a little more formal than the たら-conditional.
/// This phenomenon is somewhat universal.
/// In English, as well, it is generally more polite to use the subjunctive mood (see next section) than the indicative (statement) mood: for instance, “should you come this way” is more polite than “if you come this way.”

/// もし may be used with this type of sentence to emphasize the uncertainty of the condition.
/// もし has no one-word equivalent word in English, but it expresses a notion of something like “there may be a chance of a certain condition” or “if ever (this) should happen.”

もし、明日、彼が来なければ、大変なことになります。//If by any chance he did not come here tomorrow, it would be tragic.

/// (3) The difference between ~たら and ~ば
/// another difference between the ~たら and the ~ば conditionals has to do with talking about an event that actually happened.
/// the たら-conditional can express an unexpected consequence when the predicate of the main clause is expressed in the perfective form.
/// The main clause is in the perfective form because the event actually did happen.
/// However, the ば-conditional may not be used to talk about an event that really occurred.
/// Since the ば-adverbial indicates only an assumed situation, the main clause is always in the imperfective form.

家に帰ったら、母が来ていました。//When I went home, I was surprised to find my mother there.

/// (4) Subjunctive use
/// The subjunctive is a way to express a hypothetical situation.
/// For instance, in English, one might say, “If I were you, I wouldn’t have done that.”
/// Obviously, the speaker is not the addressee and never will be; the expression refers to an imaginary situation.

/// In Japanese, this subjunctive meaning is expressed by the たら-form more often than the ば-form.
/// This is because the syllable ~た of ~たら is the same as the perfective ~た, and an assumed completion of the situation is presented in the adverbial clause.
/// This sort of an assumed completion of the situation may not be expressed by the ば-conditional.

もし、私があなただったら、そんなことはしていなかっただろう。//If I were you, I wouldn’t have done such a thing.

/// (5) Fixed expressions with the ば-forms
/// The ば-conditional form is used in a few fixed expressions, some of which are introduced below.

/// # どうすれば
/// This construction is used to ask for advice about how best to achieve a certain thing.

どうすれば、漢字がもっと覚えられるでしょうか。//What’s the best way for me to memorize more kanji?

/// どうすれば often accompanies いい, as used in the following.

あの人に連絡できないのですが、どうすればいいと思いますか。//I can’t get in touch with him, so what do you think I should do?

/// # ~ば…ほど
/// Repeating the same verb, once with the ば-conditional and another time with the imperfective form plus ほど, indicates the incremental degree of a description expressed in the independent clause.

この本は、読めば読むほど、面白くなってきますね。//The more I read this book, the more interesting it gets.
日本語は、勉強すればするほど、難しくなってきます。//The more we study Japanese, the more difficult it becomes.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 5: Adverbial Phrases with として, としても, and としては
/// (1) として
/// A noun followed by the particle と and して is a fixed phrase indicating that the noun marked by として is a publicly-recognized category that the topic belongs to.

加藤先生は日本語の先生として、この大学で教えています。//Kato-sensei teaches at this college as a professor of Japanese.
田中先生は日本語の先生として有名です。//Tanaka-sensei is famous as a Japanese teacher.

/// (2) としても vs. としては
/// として introduced above is also used with は and も, each of which expresses a different nuance.

/// としては indicates that the attribute of the noun is less than what the speaker expected, while a noun marked with としても is more than expected:

/// # Situation 1
/// Suppose that Williams-san is an American.
/// Americans are generally expected to be taller than Japanese.
/// If the speaker judges that William-san is shorter than a regular American is expected to be, he or she would mark the noun with としては:

ウィリアムズさんは、アメリカ人としては、背が低いですね。//Williams-san is short for an American.

/// # Situation 2
/// Suppose that Williams-san is an American.
/// The speaker expects Americans to be tall, but Williamssan is even taller than other Americans.
/// In that case, the noun would be marked with としても:

ウィリアムズさんは、アメリカ人としても、背が高いですね。//Williams-san is tall even for an American.

そう？だって、何でも食べなきゃ、元気にならないわよ。//Really? But you’re not going to get better unless you eat.
うん。そうだけど。//Yeah, I know, but . . .

/// # お茶でも、飲む？ {おちゃ でも、のむ？}
/// Nouns with でも convey suggested items.
/// So, when offering tea, you can say お茶でも、飲みますか, meaning “Would you like to drink tea or something of that sort?”

/// # 今はちょっと
/// ちょっと is a colloquial expression of 少し {すこし}, but this phrase is used to decline an offer.
/// It means something like “Now is not such a good time.” 

/// # 食べる気しない   {たべる き しない}
/// In this expression, が is deleted from 気しない, and the complete phrase should be 気がしない  {き がしない}.
/// 気しない -> 気がしない
/// The idiom 気がする {きがする} means that the speaker has a certain feeling.

/// だって is a casual expression that means something similar to でも.

/// # 何でも食べなきゃ  {なん でも たべなきゃ}
/// ~なきゃ, which is very casual, is a contracted form of ~なければ in the construction introduced above.
/// As is the case with other contracted forms, this form is more colloquial than ~なければ.
