stage ２，２。
/// Stage 2-2 Adjectival Clauses
/// 1: Predicates in the Non-Final Position
/// (1) Plain forms in the final and non-final positions
/// plain forms have a number of different functions.
/// When they are used in the final position of a sentence in speech, it indicates that the relationship between speaker and addressee is close (close friends, family members, classmates, etc.);
/// when used in writing, it indicates that it is impersonal writing (the writer is not addressing any particular individual).

/// When a predicate is used in a non-final position in a sentence, the plain predicate is used regardless of the speech (or written) style.

/// (2) Compound vs. complex sentences
/// As complex sentences and compound sentences are often confused. Understanding the difference between complex sentences and compound sentences is important when forming and using plain and polite predicates.

// # Compound sentences
/// A compound sentence consists of two or more independent clauses that are joined by a conjunction.
/// an independent clause is one that can be used alone as a sentence without being preceded or followed by another clause.
/// the conjunction が may be used between two independent clauses.

/// The order of clauses in a compound sentence can be reversed without affecting meaning.
/// The order may be important for other reasons, such as politeness, or order of importance, but the logical meaning is not changed by reversing their order; this is because neither clause modifies the other.

チャンさんは中国人ですが、私は日本人です。//Chang-san is Chinese, and I’m Japanese.
私は日本人ですが、チャンさんは中国人です。//I’m Japanese, and Chang-san is Chinese.

/// The two clauses joined by が must have the same predicate form; that is, they must either be all polite or all plain. They cannot be mixed.

私は日本人だが、チャンさんは中国人だ。//I’m Japanese, and Chang-san is Chinese.

/// # Complex sentences
/// A complex sentence consists of at least one dependent clause and one independent clause.
/// the function of a dependent clause is the same as that of an adjective or adverb, but on the level of a clause rather than a word.
/// These dependent clauses are therefore called adverbial and adjectival clauses.
/// Because they function adjectivally and adverbially, they must be used before the independent clauses;
/// Unlike Compound sentences, the order cannot be reversed.

/// (3) The concept of adjectival clauses
/// These clauses are handled differently in English and Japanese.
/// The first difference is that in English, the adverbial clause is placed after the noun it modifies; in Japanese it is placed before the noun.
/// The second difference is that the pronouns “that” and “who” used in the adjectival clauses in the English sentences do not exist in Japanese.

私は昨日、買った本を読みました。//I read the book that I bought yesterday.
先生と話している男の人は私のルームメートです。//The man who is speaking with the teacher is my roommate.

/// To summarize, the following points are relevant to sentences with adjectival clauses:
/// - The adjectival clause must be placed before the noun it modifies;
/// - The predicate within the adjectival clause is in the plain form;
/// - If the two topics is the different, The topic in the adjectival clause must be marked by が, the topic in the independent clause must be marked by は.
///   If the two topics are the same, the topic in the adjectival clause is normally deleted; there is no need to mark each one with が and は.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 2: Modified Nouns
/// (1) Modifying regular nouns
/// # A noun modifying a noun -> [N1 の N0] => N0 of N1
/// the particle の must be used between the two nouns.
/// In this case, the preceding noun modifies the following one:
/// 先生の本     東京の大学

/// # An adjectival noun modifying a noun -> [adj-N な N]
/// When an adjectival noun modifies a noun, the particle な must be placed immediately before the noun it modifies.

あの人は嫌な人です。//That person is a nasty person.

/// # An adjective modifying a noun -> [adj N]
/// When an adjective modifies a noun, it is placed immediately before the noun it modifies and no particle is used between them.

これはいい本です。//This is a good book.

/// # A clause modifying a noun (adjectival clause)

私は昨日、買った本を読みました。//I read the book that I bought yesterday.
私は昨日、クリスさんが買った本を読みました。//I read the book that Kurisu-san bought yesterday.

/// any of the three predicate types (nominal, adjectival, or verbal) can be used in the adjectival clause.
/// When a nominal predicate in an adjectival clause contains a noun, の must be used between the two nouns.
/// When a nominal predicate in an adjectival clause contains an adjectival noun, な must be used between the adjectival noun and the noun.
/// When an adjectival predicate and a verbal predicate are used in an adjectival clause, no element is necessary between the adjective or the verb and the noun it modifies.

私は出身が日本の学生と友達になりました。//I made friends with a student from Japan.
私は目がとてもきれいな人と話しました。//I talked to a person with pretty eyes.
私は先生がとてもいい大学に行っています。//I go to a college that has good teachers.

私は昨日クリスさんの買った本を読みました。//I read the book that Kurisu-san bought yesterday.

/// # The use of の in adjectival clauses
/// One additional fact about adjectival clauses is that the topic, subject, and object marker が in the adjectival clause may be replaced by の in most predicates.

/// The following sentence indicates the use of の for the topic position in the adjectival clause:

私は昨日ジョンさんの買った本を読みました。//I read the book that John bought yesterday.

/// The following sentences indicate the use of の for the subject position in the adjectival clause:

私は目のとてもきれいな人と話しました。//I talked to a person with pretty eyes.
私は先生のとてもいい大学に行っています。//I go to a college with good teachers.

/// The following sentence indicates the use of の in the object position in the adjectival clause:

私は日本語の上手な学生と話しました。//I talked with a student who is good at Japanese.

/// In some isolated cases, の may replace the object marker を, especially when the object is topicalized, as shown below:

昨日、名前の知らない学生と話しました。//Yesterday I spoke to a student whose name is unknown to me.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (2) こと as a regular and functional noun
/// こと can be used as a regular noun or a functional noun.
/// As a regular noun, it refers to abstract things,
/// while もの is used to refer to concrete things or concepts (“ideas,” “music,” “habits,” and so on are examples of concepts).
/// When もの refers to concepts, it is not normally written in kanji (物).

面白いことを聞きました。//I heard an interesting thing.
面白い物を買いました。//I bought an interesting thing.
面白いものを習っています。//I am learning an interesting thing.

/// こと is here called a functional noun because it is not used as a noun with a referent, but rather gives the preceding verb a nominal function.

私は本を読むことが好きです。//I like to read books.

/// (3) の as a pronoun
/// の, on the other hand, is a pronoun, as shown below. の is used in the second sentence to refer to the noun 本.

彼は面白い本を買いました。でも、僕はつまらないの買いました。//He bought an interesting book, but I bought a boring one.

/// の is also used to nominalize the preceding verb, just as こと is.

私は本を読むのが好きです。//I like to read books.

/// (4) こと and の as nominalizers
/// こと and の as nominalizers are interchangeable in many cases.

/// The following pair of sentences illustrates that both こと and の may be used to nominalize verbs in the topic position.

日本語を話すことは難しいです。//Speaking Japanese is difficult.
日本語を話すのは難しいです。//Speaking Japanese is difficult.

/// The following sentence pair shows cases in which こと and の are used to nominalize verbs in the object position.

私は寿司を食べることが好きです。//I like to eat sushi.
私は寿司を食べるのが好きです。//I like to eat sushi.

/// Although こと and の can often be used identically, there are cases in which they are not interchangeable, such as in fixed expressions, and other differences

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 3: Fixed Expressions
/// In all of the following fixed expressions, the functional nouns such as こと and ほう are modified by adjectival clauses.

/// (1) ことができる
/// When a nominalized verb is in the object position with the verb できる, only こと rather than の may be used as a nominalizer.
/// The fixed expression with ことができる indicates the ability or possibility of the topic in the same way as the potential verb does.

僕は日本語ができます。//I have some Japanese ability.

/// The potential form is used more often in conversation than the expression with ことができる.
/// The fixed expression is more formal.

僕は日本語を話すことができます。//I can speak Japanese.
この店で日本語を話すことが出来ます。//It’s possible to speak Japanese at this store.

僕は日本語が話せます。//I can speak Japanese.
この店で日本語が話せます。//It is possible to speak Japanese at this store.

/// (2) [Perfective verb] ことがある
/// This fixed expression is used to talk about past experiences. In this structure, the perfective form must be used before ことがある.

私は日本に行ったことがあります。//I have been to Japan.

/// The noun こと in this construction means something like “occasion” or “experience.”
/// The sentence above therefore literally means that “I have the experience of having gone to Japan.”
/// In this construction, の may not be used in place of こと

/// Negative or positive responses are reflected in the last verb, ある, rather than in the non-final verb.

寿司を食べたことがありますか。//Have you ever eaten sushi?
ええ、あります。//Yes, I have.

/// In a negative response, it is common to add 一度も {いちども} “not even once” to the negative ありませ ん

いいえ、一度もありません。//No. Not even once.

/// The imperfective form should not be used before ことがある to talk about a past experience; this construction has quite a different meaning from the one with the perfective form.

/// (3) [Perfective verb] ほうがいい
/// The functional noun 方 {ほう}, which literally means “side” or “way,” is used to suggest or indicate a better or preferred way to do something.
/// For this construction, the verb must be in the perfective form.
/// The perfective form is preferred in this fixed phrase because one can judge something to be good only after the action is completed.
/// This assumed completion is expressed with the perfective form.

明日、行った方がいいですよ。//You’d better go tomorrow.

/// For a negative suggestion, the negative imperfective should be used.

明日、行かない方がいいですよ。//It would be better if you didn’t go tomorrow.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 4: [Specific Name] と いう [Generic Name]
/// (1) In a statement
/// This construction is used when the speaker assumes that the addressee does not know the specific name of the thing being discussed.
/// This expression is rather formulaic, insofar as the first noun should be a specific name, and the second noun should be a category that the specific thing named by the first noun belongs to.
/// という comes from the quotative particle と and the verb 言う {いう}, but in this expression, いう is not written in kanji.

/// 東京という所 “a place called Tokyo”
/// マイクという学生 “a student called Mike”
/// すしという食べ物 “a food called sushi”
/// 音楽というもの “a thing called music”


私はナンシーという学生に会いました。//I met a student called Nancy.
高校の先生は鈴木という先生でした。//I had a high school teacher called Suzuki

/// (2) Definition
/// There are many different ways to ask for definitions.

旅行という言葉は英語で何ですか。//What is the word for 'Ryokou' in English?

/// The pronoun の may be used in place of 言葉 {ことば} in the above sentence because the referent is clear from the context.

旅行というのは英語で何ですか。//What’s the word for 'Ryokou' in English?

/// There are many sentence structures that can be used to give definitions. The following is one such structure:

旅行というのはトラベルという意味です。//'Ryokou' means ‘travel.’

/// どういう is often used to ask for defining or rephrasing a word, a phrase, etc.

読書というのはどういう意味ですか。//What does 'Dokusho' mean?

/// ということ is often used when defining something by rephrasing.

読書というのは本を読むということです。//'Dokusho' means to read a book.

/// (3) ということ
/// is used to rephrase the content of a message.

私はあの人はー年生だということを聞きました。//I heard someone saying that he was a freshman.
私は昨日のテストは易しかったということを聞きました。//I heard someone saying that yesterday’s test was easy.

/// Compare the above with the following:

私はあの人は一年生だと聞きました。//I heard someone saying that guy was a freshman.
私は昨日のテストは易しかったと聞きました。//I heard someone saying that yesterday’s test was easy.

/// The difference between the sentences with and without ということ is as follows:
/// - Sentences without ということ express the content of what the speaker has heard directly.
/// - Sentences with ということ indicate that the speaker has rephrased his or her own understanding from what he or she has heard someone say about the content.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

/// (1) What did she say?

お母さん、何て？//What did Mom say?
うん。あまり好きじゃないって。//Um, she said she didn’t like it all that much.

/// # 何て {なんて}？
/// 何て is a colloquial version of 何と言いましたか “What did (someone) say?” This expression is used very often in conversation.

/// ~って in spoken language is a shortened version of と言いました, meaning “(someone) said such-and-such.”
/// Therefore, the content of the message goes before ~って.

/// (2) What do you mean?

それ、どういうこと？　行かないっていうこと？//What do you mean by that? Does that mean you won’t go?
まあ、そういうこと。//Yeah, pretty much.


/// # どういうこと
/// This expression is used to ask for some clarification of what the speaker has just heard the addressee say; it means something like “What do you mean by that?”

/// ~っていうこと used in the predicate is a colloquial version of ということ, meaning “I mean (content).”

/// # そういうこと
/// This expression is used to concur with what the other person has said, thought, or assumed.
/// When used in a question, it is used to confirm the other person’s (or sometimes one’s own) understanding of what was said.
/// こういうこと may also be used to summarize what the speaker has said.

/// (3) What does it mean?

登山って、どういう意味？//What does 'tosan' mean?
山に登るってことよ。//It means to climb mountains.

/// # ~って in the first clause
/// 登山って {とざんって} is a shortened spoken version of 登山というのは.
/// 登る {のぼる} means “to climb.”

/// (4) That’s too bad

彼、何て行ってた？//What did he say?
行かないって。//He said he’s not going.
そう。残念だけど、しかたないね。//Really. That’s too bad, but what can we do?

/// # 残念 {ざんねん}
/// This adjectival noun means that the speaker feels sorry about what he or she has just heard or learned about.

/// # しかたない
/// This is a shortened phrase; the complete expression is しかたがない.
/// しかた means “way of dealing with something.”
/// So, the literal meaning of this expression is “There’s no way to deal with this.”
/// This phrase, which is used when the speaker wishes to indicate that he or she will have to accept a situation as it is.
/// Another expression, しようがない, has the same meaning as しかたがない;
/// しようがない is often contracted to しょうがない when speaking colloquially.
