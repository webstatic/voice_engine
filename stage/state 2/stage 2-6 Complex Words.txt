/// Stage 2-6 Complex Words

/// 1: Complex Adjectives
/// (1) What are complex words?
/// Words formed by combining other words are called complex words.
/// A complex word consists of the stem of a predicate joined by another word such as a verb, an adjective, an adverb, or a noun.

/// Classification of a complex word is based on its final component.
/// For instance, a complex word is an adjective if it consists of the stem of a predicate and an adjective, and a noun if it is formed by the stem of a predicate and a noun.

/// In this chapter, a variety of complex words will be introduced, including complex adjectives, complex verbs, complex nouns, and complex adjectival nouns.

/// (2) [Stem + やすい(易い)] -> express that the speaker can easily perform the act named by the verb
/// The stem of a predicate and the adjective やすい together express that the speaker can easily perform the act named by the verb.

/// The topic of this construction is the thing or the person the speaker describes.

この漢字は書きやすいですが、その漢字はあまり書きやすくありません。//This kanji is easy to write, but that one is not so easy to write.
この人の書いた手紙は読みやすかったです。//This person’s letters were easy to read.
この新しい外国のペンは書きやすくありませんでした。//The new, foreign pen wasn’t easy to write with.

/// The following example illustrates how a complex adjective modifies a noun:

この書きやすいペンはだれのですか。//Who owns this pen that’s so easy to write with?

/// Non-active verbs are not used in this construction
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (3) [Stem + にくい(難い)] -> indicates that the topic poses some kind of difficulty for the speaker.
/// This construction indicates that the topic poses some kind of difficulty for the speaker.

この本は分かりにくいです。//This book is hard to understand.
あの先生には本当に話しにくかったです。//That teacher was very difficult to talk to.

/// The following is an example of using this complex adjective before a noun:

この分かりにくい本は父が書いた物です。//This hard-to-understand book was written by my father.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 2: Complex Verbs
/// (1) [Stem + 過（す）ぎる] -> the action denoted by the first element is performed in excess
/// This construction is used when the action denoted by the first element is performed in excess. It is also used in excessive or hyperbolic descriptions.

/// # With verbs

昨日、食べ過ぎました。//I ate too much yesterday.
パーティーで飲みすぎないでください。//Please don’t drink too much at the party.

/// # With adjectives
/// The stems of adjectives are formed by dropping the final い. Use the stem of an adjective and add 過（す）ぎる.

今日は、私には、寒過ぎます。//It’s too cold for me today.
あの人は頭がよすぎると皆に言われています。//Everyone says that he’s too smart.

/// # With adjectival nouns
/// Adjectival nouns do not have stems since they do not conjugate. In this construction, they come immediately before 過（す）ぎる.

この部屋は静か過ぎます。//This room is too quiet.

/// # With nouns
/// Some nouns may also be used in this construction, if the noun can imply certain degrees.

あの学生は子供過ぎます。//That student is too childish.
あの学生は金持ち過ぎて、貧乏な人の気持ちは分からないでしょうね。//That student has too much money, so he probably doesn’t understand how poor people feel.

/// # With negative predicates
/// Although rare, it is possible to use the negative predicate in this construction.
/// All negative predicates contain ない, which follows the same conjugational pattern as adjectives.
/// In this construction, ない with 過（す）ぎる produces なさ過（す）ぎる with さ intervening between the syllable な and すぎる. (This kind of insertion happens when there are too few syllables between two separate elements.)

うちの子は元気がなさ過ぎます。//Our child is too unwell these days.
ここには頭のいい人がいなさ過ぎます。//There are too few smart people here.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (2) Stem with other verbs
/// # 始（はじ）める -> [Stem + 始（はじ）める] -> "indicates the beginning of an event"
/// 始（はじ）める is a transitive verb and meaning “to begin something.”
/// The complex verb formed from this verb indicates the beginning of an event:

晩ご飯を作り始めましょうか。//Shall we begin making supper?
宿題をし始めました。//I have begun doing my homework.

/// # 出（だ）す -> [Stem + 出（だ）す] -> "denotes the beginning of a continuous action or event"
/// The verb 思い出す（おもいだす） “to recall”; this verb in fact consists of the stem of the verb 思（おも）う and the verb 出（だ）す.
/// This complex verb literally means something like “to take out what has been memorized.”

ああ、あの人の名前を思い出しました。//Oh, now I remember that person’s name.

/// Although 出（だ）す “to take something out” itself is transitive, it can be combined with both intransitive and transitive verbs.
/// This expression has an inceptive or inchoative sense, that is, it denotes the beginning of a continuous action or event.

雨が降り出しました。//It started to rain.

/// Complex verbs with 出（だ）す are very similar to those with 始（はじ）める.
/// Compare the following two sentences:

あの人はゆっくり話し出しました。//The person slowly began speaking.
あの人はゆっくり話し始めました。//The person slowly began speaking.

/// When the speaker anticipates the beginning of an event, 始（はじ）める may be used; while an unanticipated event may be expressed with 出（だ）す.
/// Thus, the first sentence above means that the person began talking and the speaker had not expected it;
/// the second sentence implies that the speech of the person, which the speaker had anticipated, began.

/// A similar nuance informs the difference in meaning between the following two sentences:

あの子供は泣き出しました。//The child began to cry.
あの子供は泣き始めました。//The child began to cry.

/// The first sentence indicates that the child began to cry when no one was expecting it to.
/// But the second sentence makes it sound as if people had been waiting for the child to cry, which could happen, for example, in a dramatic play.

/// # 直（なお）す -> [Stem + 直（なお）す] -> "an action is repeated"
/// 直（なお）す by itself means “to correct” or “to repair.” 

コンピュータを直しました。//I fixed the computer.

/// When combined with the stem of another verb, the combined meaning implies that an action is repeated.

この本を読み直しました。//I re-read this book.
手紙を書き直しました。//I re-wrote the letter.

/// # 忘（わす）れる -> [Stem + 忘（わす）れる] -> "to express forgetting to do something"
/// 忘（わす）れる by itself means “to forget.”

かさを学校に忘れました。//I forgot my umbrella at school.

/// There are two ways to express forgetting to do something:
/// 1. use the stem of a verb and 忘（わす） れる;
/// 2. nominalize the verb with の in the object position (the use of こと rather than の is acceptable, but の is preferable).

母に電話し忘れました。//I forgot to call my mother.
母に電話するのを忘れました。//I forgot to call my mother.

/// Although there is only a small difference between the two sentences above, in certain cases the two structures are not interchangeable.

/// When the action indicated is from one point to a goal (e.g. going, returning, etc.), the use of complex verbs with 忘（わす）れる is awkward.
/// In this case, use the nominalized verb with の.

図書館に行くのを忘れました。//I forgot to go to the library.
今日、歩くのを忘れた。//I forgot to go for a walk today.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 3: Complex Nouns with 方（かた）
/// 方（かた） means “method” or “way”; thus, the coupling of a verb stem with this noun means “a way of (doing something).”
/// An equivalent expression in English is “how to do something.”

/// 読み方 “the way of reading” (how to read)
/// 書き方 “the way of writing” (how to write)
/// 食べ方 “the way of eating” (how to eat)

/// The combined words form a complex noun, so it is important to pay attention to the use of the particle の between the modifying noun and the modified noun.

今日は、手紙の書き方を習いました。//I learned how to write letters today.
すみませんが、この漢字の読み方を教えて下さいませんか。//Excuse me, but could you tell me how to read this kanji?

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 4: Complex Adjectival Nouns with そう
/// Attaching そう to the stem of a predicate creates an adjectival noun that expresses the speaker’s inference based on his or her direct and immediate observation.

/// (1) With adjectives and adjectival nouns

あの店のお茶はおいしそうです。//The tea at that shop looks delicious.
ここは静かそうです。//This place feels/looks quiet.

/// For the adjective いい and the negative ~ない, さ must be inserted between the first syllable and そう.

この本はよさそうです。//This book looks good
このケーキはおいしくなさそうです。//This cake doesn’t look very tasty.

/// (2) With nouns
/// A noun cannot precede そう, but there is an equivalent word, みたい.

あの人は日本人みたいです。//That person looks Japanese.

/// (3) As a modifier
/// Because complex words with みたい and そう are adjectival nouns, they must be followed by な when they modify a noun.

これはおいしそうなケーキですね。//This is a delicious-looking cake, isn’t it?
あの日本人みたいな人はだれですか。//Who is that Japanese-looking person?

/// (4) With Verbs
/// The stem of a verb joined to the suffix ~そう also indicates the immediacy of an observed event.
/// This means that the speaker believes that something will occur very soon, based upon what he or she has observed.

雨が降りそうです。//It looks like it’s going to rain at any second.
今日は晴れそうですね。//It looks like it’s going to clear up today.

/// (5) Complex words with more than two elements
/// Complex words may consist of more than two elements.

雨が降り出しそうです。//It looks like it’s going to start raining at any second.
この本は読みやすそうですね。//This book looks like it’s easy to read.
この食べにくそうな食べ物は何ですか。//What is this food that looks like it’s hard to eat?

/// # ~そう and ようだ
/// As explained in earlier chapters, ようだ is used at the end of a sentence to express the speaker’s inference based on his or her observation.
/// The difference between the two is that an expression with ようだ lacks the immediacy of an expression including the stem with ~そう.

雨が降りそうですね。//It looks like it’s going to rain at any second.
雨が降るようですね。//It looks like it may rain.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 5: Stems Used for Different Speech Levels
/// the honorific system in Japanese is quite complex.
/// the use of honorifics reflects the relation between the topic of a sentence and the speaker,
/// while the use of politeness depends on the relationship between the speaker and the addressee.

/// Here, a few more facts and the situations of the honorific system will be explained.

/// (1) Inviting and giving instructions

/// # Polite commands and requests -> [~てください and ~てくださいませんか]

これを日本語で言って下さい。//Please say this in Japanese.
すみませんが、こちらに立たないで下さいませんか。//I’m sorry, but could you please not stand here?

/// # Inviting someone to do something -> [お + Stem + ください]
/// as when inviting a guest to enter the house or to sit somewhere
/// どうぞ is often added to further urge or invite someone to do something.

どうぞ、お入りください。//Please come (or go) in.
こちらにお座りください。//Please sit here.

お上がり下さい。//Please come in.

/// There is no real negative counterpart to the structure above, probably because invitations are generally not given in the negative form.
/// There are many expressions of prohibition, however.
/// Depending on the situation, it is possible to use the negative command or request in certain cases:

入らないで下さい（ませんか）。//Please do not enter.

/// # Giving instructions to children or students -> [Stem + なさい]
/// Parents or school teachers may use the structure to give instructions or (at times) orders to small children:

野菜をいっぱい食べなさい。//Eat lots of vegetables.

/// This structure is also used in examination instructions, in which case the recipients are not only small children.

次の言葉を漢字で書きなさい。//Write the following words in kanji.

/// Here, too, there is no exact negative counterpart, but some examples are given below (sentencefinal particles used in conversation, such as ね and よ, are used in the following example sentences because they are conversational):

ここを走らないでね。//Don’t run here.

/// Alternatively, in spoken Japanese, the following structure with ~てはだめ or ~てはいけません in the predicate may be used:

ここを走っては、だめですよ。//running here is no good
ここを走っては、いけませんよ。//it won’t do to run here
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (2) Honorific forms
/// For honorific verbs, there are at least three ways (actually, there are more) for the speaker to show his or her respect for the topic of the sentence.

/// # Irregular honorific verbs
/// There are a handful of irregular honorific verbs.
/// The irregular honorific verbs いらっしゃる（いらっしゃ います）, おっしゃる（おっしゃいます）, and くださる（くださいます） have already been introduced.

ウィリアムズ先生は次の試験は長くないとおっしゃいました。//Williams-sensei said that the next test would not be long.

/// # Formulaic honorific verbs -> [お + Stem + に + なる]
/// Not all verbs have separate honorific verbs. Most honorific verbs are derived from the construction:

先生はこの本をお読みになりました。//The teacher read this book.
森先生がこの本をお書きになりました。//Mori-sensei is the one who wrote this book.

/// # Passive forms
/// may also be used to express respect, though they are less honorific than the two constructions above.

先生も明日、行かれますか。//Will you also go tomorrow, Sensei?
先輩はこれをもう読まれましたか。//Have you already read this, Senpai?
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (3) Humble forms
/// Humble verbs, which are a part of the honorific system in Japanese,
/// are used to refer to the speaker’s (or his/her うち-group’s) own action in the presence of someone the speaker respects.
/// Just like honorific verbs, there are irregular and regular humble forms.

/// # Irregular humble verbs
/// There are a handful of humble verbs that are irregular insofar as they are not derived from the base forms of corresponding verbs.

/// 申（もう）す is the humble version of the neutral verb 言（い）う;

私はリンと申します。//I’m Lin.
私はリンと言います。//I’m Lin.

/// 参（まい）る is the humble version of the directional verbs 行（い）く and 来（く）る.

私は明日、こちらに参りません。//I won’t come here tomorrow.
私は明日、そちらに参りません。//I won’t go there tomorrow.

/// Formulaic humble verbs -> [お + Stem + する]
/// Most verbs do not have separate humble verbs. For those verbs, use the construction:

/// Irregular and formulaic humble verbs are different with respect to when the speaker should use them.
/// Formulaic humble verbs are used only when the speaker does or did something for the person for whom he or she expresses his or her respect.
/// If the action is not done for that person, a formulaic humble verb should not be used.
/// Irregular humble forms do not have this restriction; that is, they may be used for the speaker’s action that is not performed for other people.

私がお書きします。//I will write it for you.
お読みしましょうか。//Shall I read it for you?

カンバセーション。

/// (1) Welcoming a visitor

ごめんください。//Hello!
はあい。ああ、林さん、いらっしゃい（ませ）。どうぞ、お上がりください。//Yes? Oh, Hayashi-san, welcome. Please do come in.
お邪魔します。//Thank you.

/// ごめんください can be used to announce one’s arrival when visiting people at their home.
/// It is used at the entrance, when the speaker is afraid the host has not noticed that he or she is there.
/// can also be used as a closing phrase when talking on the phone.

/// # いらっしゃい（ませ）
/// The host normally welcomes the guest with this greeting. 
/// ませ makes this expression more polite.

/// # お上（あ）がりください
/// the verb 上（あ）がる literally means “to rise.”


/// # お邪魔（じゃま）します
/// 邪魔（じゃま） is an adjectival noun that means “interference.”
/// お邪魔（じゃま）します is used often when going into someone else’s house, room, or office.


/// (2) I wonder…

あの人、だれ？//Who’s that?
井上さんじゃない？//Isn’t that Inoue-san?
井上さん、何だか、話しにくい人じゃない？//Don’t you think she’s kind of hard to talk to?
ううん・・・そうかな？でも、あの人、とってもかわいそうな人・・・//Huh . . . I guess that’s true, isn’t it? But, you know, I feel really sorry for her.
へえ？そうなの？//Is that right?

/// 何（なん）だか, which means “for some reason,” is used in conversation to express that the reason for a certain thing is not very clear to the speaker.

/// # Rhetorical question with かな
/// かな is used in conversation, when the speaker expresses a question about something without addressing it to anyone but him or herself;
/// the nuance is something like, “I wonder if (such-and-such).”

/// かわいそう should be regarded as a single word rather than a complex word.
/// The speaker can use this adjectival noun when he or she feels sorry for someone, no matter the reason.

/// (3) For example

あなたが嫌いな人って、どんな人？//What kind of people get on your nerves?
そうねえ。例えば、話しすぎる人とか、いつも文句を言う人・・・。//Um, let’s see. For example, people who talk too much, or people who complain all the time.

/// The noun 文句（もんく） means “complaint.”
/// The associated verb is 言（い）う, “to say.”
/// The phrase 文 句を言う（もんくをいう） therefore means “to complain.”
