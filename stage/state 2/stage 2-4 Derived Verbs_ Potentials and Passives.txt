/// Stage 2-4 Derived Verbs: Potentials and Passives

/// 1: Potential Verbs and Sentences
/// (1) Derived verbs
/// the three types of derived verbs include potential, passive, and causative verbs.

/// (2) Potential verbs
/// When potential verbs were introduced as independent verbs, only their ability-related meaning was given.
/// however, potential verbs can also express possibility (that is, something that is possible in some situations).

/// # Ability-related meaning
/// The following sentences express the topic’s ability to do something.

クリスさんは日本語が上手に話せます。//Kurisu-san can speak Japanese well.
私は運転出来ません。//I cannot drive.

/// # Possibility-related meaning
/// Some verbs that do not involve skill or action indicate only possibility, not ability.

明日は日本語の授業に行けません。//I cannot go to Japanese class tomorrow.
ナンシーさんは明日から図書館でアルバイト出来ます。//It will be possible for Nancy to work at the library starting tomorrow.
日本に三週間いられます。//I can stay in Japan for three weeks.

/// Derived potential forms of action verbs have both ability- and possibility-related meanings depending on the context.
/// For instance, the potential verb 話せる may be used for both meanings. (See above for the ability-related meaning with this verb.)
/// As for the possibility-related meaning with the potential forms of action verbs, the topic is often not explicitly expressed.

この店では日本語が話せます。//In this store, we can speak Japanese.

/// # Expressing possibility-related meaning with かもしれない
/// Some semi-transitive verbs, such as 分かる and ある, have no potential forms because this type of verb does not refer to an action, and thus cannot express ability.
/// Other constructions must be used to express the idea of possibility with these verbs.

/// One construction that can be used to express possibility with these verbs is the sentence-ending expression かもしれない.

あの人はお金がたくさんあるかもしれません。//It’s possible that that person has a lot of money.
あの人は日本語が分かるかもしれません。//It’s possible that that person understands Japanese.

/// When the speaker wants to express more certainty that the situation is true, the volitional copula だろう may be used.

あの人はお金がたくさんあるでしょう。//I’m quite certain that that person has a lot of money.
あの人は日本語が分かるでしょう。//I’m sure that that person understands Japanese.

/// In either case, the possibilities expressed by the potential forms and those expressed by かもしれな い or だろう are not quite parallel to each other.

/// With the potential form, the possibility lies in whether or not the topic is able to carry out the action.
/// When かもしれない or だろう are used, the possibility lies in whether or not the situation is true, with somewhat different degrees of uncertainty.
/// For this reason, both かもしれない and だろう may be used even with potential verbs.

あの店では日本語が話せるかもしれません。//You may be able to speak Japanese at that store.

/// 2: Passive Verbs and Sentences
/// (1) Passive verb formation
/// Group 1, 2: Change the final vowel u to the vowel a and add れる
/// Group 3: [する → される], [くる → こられる]

/// all derived passive forms are Group 1 verbs.

/// (2) Different passive sentences in Japanese
/// In both English and Japanese, passive sentences appear more often in formal writing than in casual speech.

/// In Japanese, there are two different kinds of passive sentences.
/// - One is a regular passive, used most often in formal writing or speech.
/// - The other is a passive expressing that the speaker has been affected by a certain event, resulting in a feeling that is often undesirable.
/// This type of passive, which is used rather frequently in daily conversation, is called the affective passive.
/// Because this type of passive is emotive, the topic is normally the speaker.

/// (3) Regular passive sentences
/// he use of regular passives occurs most often in written work such as essays, or in formal speech.
/// The topic of the essay is often used as the topic of passive sentences.
/// For instance, if an essay is discussing 日本語, 日本語 may be used as the topic of the essay’s opening statement.

日本語は日本でだけ話されています。//Japanese is spoken only in Japan.

/// Regular passives do have active counterparts

この大学では、多くの学生が日本語を勉強しています。//Many students study Japanese at this college.
この大学では、日本語は多くの学生に勉強されています。//At this college, Japanese is studied by many students.

/// The particle に is used to mark the person who does the action in a regular passive sentence.
/// によって instead of に can also be used in some cases.

この本は有名な作家に書かれました。//This book was written by a famous writer.

/// While the particle に and によって may mark the person who acts, に is the particle used for all types of passive predicates.
/// によって is not used for the verbs that have emotive meanings, such as scolding and praising, as shown in the incorrect sentence below.
/// In cases when both に and によって are acceptable, the use of によって sounds more formal than に.

日本の生徒は先生に時々、叱られます。//Students in Japan are occasionally scolded by their teachers.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (4) Affective passive sentences
/// In English, because passive sentences are formed by making the object of the active sentence into the subject of the passive sentence, only transitive sentences can be converted into passive sentences.

/// In Japanese, passive verbs can also be used in sentences in which the speaker expresses an emotional response to an event.
/// Feelings such as annoyance or surprise can be conveyed by the use of passive verbs.
/// In this type of passive sentence, even intransitive action verbs may be used in some situations.
/// However, semi-transitive verbs, and the intransitive counterpart of a transitive-intransitive verb pair (such as the intransitive, 始（はじ）まる, whose transitive counterpart is 始（はじ）める)
/// may not be used even in affective passives.

/// The structures of the regular passive and affective passive are inherently different.
/// In affective passives, the person who is affected—again, most often the speaker—is the topic of the sentence.
/// Unlike regular passive sentences, the topic of the affective passive does not appear in the active counterpart

/// Active:

雨がふりました。//It rained.

/// Passive:

私は雨に降られました。//I was affected by the fact that rain fell.


去年、私達は犬に死なれました。//Last year, we were saddened by the death of our dog.
私は映画館で子供に泣かれました。//I was really annoyed by the child’s crying in the theater.
私は先生に私の家に来られました。//I was shocked that my teacher came to my house.

/// The sentences above are translated idiomatically, as there is really no way to provide word-for-word translations for sentences of this type.

/// Unlike a regular passive, when a transitive sentence is converted into an affective passive, the direct object in the active sentence remains the direct object in the affective passive.
/// The person affected by the event is the topic, and does not appear in the active sentence.

/// Active:

友達はボーイフレンドからの手紙を読みました。//My friend read my boyfriend’s letter.

/// Passive:

私は友達にボーイフレンドからの手紙を読まれました。//I was upset about being scolded by the teacher.

/// In many affective passive sentences, the topic is not mentioned, because it is clear that the speaker is the one who is emotionally affected.

/// Some passives are affective passives by nature, even though they have the structure of a regular passive, because of the inherent meaning of the verb.
/// This is particularly true of emotive verbs.

/// Active:

先生は私を叱りました。//The teacher scolded me.

/// Passive:

私は先生に叱られました。//I was upset about being scolded by the teacher.

/// # Affective passives with ~てしまう
/// ~てしまう is often used with the affective passives.
/// Recall that ~てしまう may be used to express a certain unexpected and unintentional result.
/// As the circumstances in which affective passives are used are by nature unexpected, this resultative expression is commonly used in affective passive sentences.

昨日、先生に叱られてしまいました。//I ended up being scolded by the teacher.
卒業式で雨に降られてしまいました。//It turned out that it rained at the graduation ceremony.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (5) Passive and potential sentences
/// In terms of their formation, the passive and potential forms of Group 1 verbs and 来（く）る are identical.
/// The two forms are used in different structures, however, so the meanings of each are clear.

このケーキが食べられますか。//Can you eat this cake?
私は妹にケーキを食べられました。//I was upset that my sister ate my cake.

/// Unlike Group 1 verbs, potentials and passives of the Group 2 verbs and する have different forms.

ここで日本語が話せます。//We can speak Japanese here.
日本語はここでも話されています。//Japanese is spoken even here.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (6) Passives in English and Japanese
/// When the speaker receives some kind of benefit, the use of a passive sentence is not appropriate in Japanese.

/// It is allowed in English, however, as in the following example:
/// - Japanese is taught by Professor Tanaka.
/// - I was taught Japanese by Professor Tanaka.
/// The second sentence cannot be expressed as a passive sentence in Japanese, because the implication is that the topic is receiving some kind of benefit or favor from Professor Tanaka.

/// To express this meaning, the following structure must be used:

私は田中先生に日本語を教えていただきました。//I was taught Japanese by Tanaka-sensei.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 3: て-forms with Giving and Receiving Verbs
/// All verbs of giving and receiving may be combined with other verbs in the て-form.
/// In these cases, what the topic gives and receives are the benefits of actions rather than things.
/// The central meaning of this construction is therefore “doing a favor for or receiving a favor from another individual.”
/// In English, this nuance is expressed by the preposition “for,” as in “I read the book for the child,” or “Mary made the cake for me.” 

/// (1) ~てあげる（さしあげる・やる）
/// This construction indicates that the topic does a favor for another person.
/// The use of あげる, さしあげる, and やる depends on the relationship between the topic and the recipient of the favor.

私は母に英語の手紙を読んであげました。//I read the letter in English for my mother.
私は友達のおばあさんに新聞を読んでさしあげました。//I read the newspaper for my friend’s grandmother.
私は弟の宿題をしてやりました。//I did my younger brother’s homework for him.

/// This construction should be used with care, because when a speaker talks about doing a favor for others, it can seem boastful in the context of Japanese culture.
/// The topic may do something for someone voluntarily, or at the request of the receiver; it is not always clear which is the case.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (2) ~てくれる（くださる）
/// When the verbs くれる or くださる are used, the recipient is always the speaker or the speaker’s うちgroup.
/// The particle が is often used as the topic marker in this type of sentence because the sentence often expresses who is the person who has offered or will offer the favor.

ルームメートがこの漢字を教えてくれました。//My roommate is the one who taught me this kanji.
伊藤先生がこの漢字を教えてくださいました。//Ito-sensei is the one who taught me this kanji.
時雨さんが弟に本を読んでくれました。//Shigure-sensei is the one who taught me this kanji.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (3) ~てもらう（いただく）
/// This construction is used when the topic receives a favor from someone else,
/// most often as the result of a request or in a prearranged situation.

僕はルームメートにこの漢字を教えてもらいました。//I had my roommate teach me this kanji.
マイクさんは鈴木先生にこの漢字を教えていただきました。//Mike asked Professor Suzuki to teach him this kanji.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (4) Comparison between ~てくれる and ~てもらう
/// The following is a summary of the different situations in which ~てくれる（くださる） and ~てもらう（いただく） may be used.
/// In both of the sentences below, Taro, a man, read the letter for the speaker:

太郎さんが日本語の手紙を読んでくれました。//Taro read the Japanese letter for me.
私は日本語の手紙を太郎さんに読んでもらいました。//I had Taro read the Japanese letter for me.

/// The person who did the action of reading the letter is in the topic position in the sentence with ~く れる（くださる）.
/// In contrast, the person who has asked and received the favor is the topic in the sentence with ~もらう（いただく）.

/// In the first sentence with ~くれる（くださる）, the focus is Taro, who has offered the action of reading.
/// This action may have taken place because the speaker has asked Taro to do so, or Taro may have volunteered (the use of が for the topic indicates the latter).

/// In the second sentence with ~もらう（いただく）, the speaker asked Taro to read the letter, perhaps because the speaker cannot read Japanese.
/// As a result of this request, the speaker (the topic) received Taro’s help, namely, the reading of the letter.
/// In this case, the speaker is the topic, since the speaker initiated the asking, and the sentence is structured to communicate this fact.
/// This construction is generally used to talk about a favor that the speaker has received as the result of his or her own request.

/// # Causative sentences and ~てもらう（いただく）
/// causative verbs can be used in sentences in which one person makes another do something.
/// This may seem similar to the sentences with ~てもらう（いただく）.
/// The difference is that the topic of a causative sentence is usually someone who has a certain authority over the person whom the topic makes do something; this is not the case with sentences with ~てもらう （いただく）.
/// Another difference is that sentences with ~てもらう（いただく） imply that the topic has requested that another do something, while causative sentences do not imply any such request.

先生は学生に漢字を書かせました。//The teacher made the students write kanji.
先生は学生に漢字を書いてもらいました。//The teacher had a student write kanji for him.

/// # Noun のために
/// This phrase, a noun with のために, is used to indicate the recipient of a favor in some constructions.
/// ために, rather than に, is used to avoid confusion as to whether the destination or the beneficiary is being named.

/// Suppose the speaker’s grandmother is ill, so she cannot go shopping.
/// In this situation, the grandmother is the beneficiary on whose behalf the speaker is going to the store.

/// It is better to use ために in place of the first に:

私は叔母さんのために店に行ってあげました。//I went to the store for my grandmother.

/// ために may also be used in cases when に is normally used to indicate the beneficiary of the topic’s action.
/// When both ために and に are possible, the benefit is much more greatly emphasized with た めに than に.
/// Because of this, an inappropriate use of ために may convey the nuance that the gift was overbearing.

私はおばあさんのためにおいしいケーキを作ってあげました。//I made a great cake for my grandmother.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 4: て-forms for Expressing the Cause
/// (1) Different causes
/// Up to this point in the course, only the adverbial clause with the conjunction から has been introduced to express cause.
/// Clauses with ので also express cause.
/// Another way to express cause is to end the first clause with the て-form.
/// This indicates that the first clause is the reason for the result expressed in the second clause.
/// The distinction in this construction is that the result occurs naturally, rather than being a result of the speaker’s action:

漢字が難しくて、私はこの本が読めません。//I can’t read this book because the kanji are too difficult.

/// Emotive expressions, such as the verb 困（こま）る in the following sentence, are often used in the result clause:

雨が降って、困りました。//It rained, and that caused me some problems.

/// (2) Apologizing
/// Ending the first clause with the て-form is a construction commonly used to form an apology:

昨日、授業に来なくて、すみません（でした）。//I’m sorry I didn’t come to class yesterday.

/// A very common mistake when expressing an apology is to connect the two clauses with the conjunction から (or ので), as in the following incorrect sentence:

/// An apology is best connected with the て-form because it indicates that the speaker’s regret emerges naturally, rather than being the chosen consequence of a causal event.

/// (3) Thanking
/// If the speaker is thanking someone for a specific thing that he or she received, を is used, though it may be deleted in casual conversation:

面白い本をありがとうございます。//Thank you for the interesting book.

/// When a speaker thanks someone else, it is because that person has done something nice for him or her.
/// It is therefore most natural that, following the main clause, the first clause contains some kind of giving or receiving verb.
/// Without this, the expression is often inappropriate.

手伝ってくれて、ありがとう。//Thank you for helping me.

/// The following is a more polite version of the above sentence; the verb くださる is used rather than く れる, with ございます added at the end.

手伝ってくださって、ありがとうございます。//Thank you for helping me.

/// Mistakes commonly made when expressing appreciation include 
/// 1. not using a verb of giving or receiving;
/// 2. joining the first clause to the second clause by から (or ので);
/// 3. using a form other than the て-form in the first clause.

カンバセーション。

/// (1) Thanking someone for advice

今日も授業で皆に笑われたんです。//People laughed at me again today in class.
ええ？ そうなんですか。どうしたんですか。//Really? Tell me what happened.
全然、知りませんでした。教えてくださって、本当にありがとうございます。//I didn’t know that at all. Thank you very much for telling me.

/// # どうしたんですか
/// the use of ~んですか suggests that the speaker is urging or encouraging the addressee to explain the situation.

/// (2) How did you get here?

どうやってここまで来られたんですか。//How did you manage to get here?
父に乗せてもらって来たんです。//I asked my father to give me a ride.

/// # どうやって
/// やって in this phrase is from the verb やる “to do,” a colloquial verb equivalent in meaning to する.
/// どうやって is a way of asking how things are done.

/// # 乗（の）せてもらって
/// 乗（の）せる is a verb meaning “to give a ride.”

彼は私を車に乗せてくれた。//He gave me a ride in his car.

/// (3) Feeling upset about a bad grade

中間試験、ものすごく悪い点をつけられました。//I got a really bad grade on the midterm.
勉強しなかったんですか。僕もあまりいい成績はもらいませんでした。//Was it because you didn’t study for it? I didn’t do very well, either.
一生懸命、勉強したんですが、ちょっと風邪をひいていたんです。//I studied as hard as I could, but I caught a bit of a cold.
それはいけませんね。気をつけてください。//That’s too bad [about the cold]. Please do take care.

/// # 成績（せいせき）をつける and 点（てん）をつける
/// 成績（せいせき） “grade” and 点（てん） “point” are used to express the grade one receives in a course, on a test, etc.
/// The verbs used with these words are つける (for giving a grade) and もらう (for receiving one).

/// 一生懸命（いっしょうけんめい） is used with the particle に, though the particle may be deleted in casual conversation.
/// The phrase means that one does something “as hard as one possibly can.”
/// 一所懸 命（いっしょけんめい） (i.e., the second kanji pronounced with a short しょ) is also commonly used.

/// # 気（き）をつける
/// There are quite a few idiomatic phrases with the noun 気（き）, “spirit; mind; heart.”
/// 気（き）をつける indicates that a person pays attention to things, or is careful about certain things.
/// The thing that the topic pays attention to is marked by に.

車に気をつけてください。//Watch out for cars, please.
