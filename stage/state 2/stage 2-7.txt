/// Stage 2-7 Complex Predicates
/// 1: Complex Predicates with つもりだ and はずだ
/// (1) Complex Predicates -> is a predicate consisting of two or more elements

/// (2) つもりだ-> can be added to a predicate to indicate the speaker’s plan.

私は来年、日本で勉強するつもりです。//I plan to study in Japan next year.
来年、日本で勉強しないつもりです。//My plan is not to study in Japan next year.

/// By negating the copula, the speaker corrects the other person’s positive assumption.

来年、日本で勉強するつもりじゃありません。//Actually, I don’t plan to go to Japan to study next year.

/// Restriction on the use of the construction - This construction therefore is not used to discuss a third person’s plan or intention.

カーターさんは、来年、どこで勉強するつもりですか。//Where do you plan to study next year, Carter-san?
私はイギリスで勉強するつもりです。//I plan to study in England.

/// A third person’s intent may be expressed by reporting what he or she has said, by expressing the speaker’s belief with the verb 思（おも）う, or by using other complex predicates.
/// This construction indicates that the speaker is expressing his or her understanding of the third person’s intent.

リンさんは来年、日本で勉強するつもりだと言っていました。//Lin-san said that he plans to study in Japan next year.
ウィリアムズさんは来年、日本で勉強するつもりだと思います。//I believe Williams-san is planning to study in Japan next year.

/// (3) はずだ -> expresses the speaker’s expectation of a certain event; the event need not relate directly to the speaker.

カーターさんは来年、日本で勉強するはずです。//It is my understanding that Carter-san will study in Japan next year.
私は来年、日本に行けるはずです。//I believe that I’ll be able to go to Japan next year.

/// The difference between はず and 思（おも）う
/// they each convey a different nuance. 思う expresses the speaker’s personal opinion, but はずだ an objective expectation the speaker infers from some source.

もうすぐ、先生はいらっしゃるはずです。//I expect the teacher to be here very soon.
もうすぐ、先生はいらっしゃると思います。//I think the teacher will be here soon.

/// はずだ expresses the speaker’s belief regarding a certain fact or event, but it may not be used to express a specific personal opinion arising from direct experience. In the latter case, 思（おも）う would be used.

日本語を勉強しているんですか。//Is it true that you’re studying Japanese?
ええ、日本語は難しいですが、本当におもしろい言葉だと思います。//Yes. Japanese is difficult, but I think it’s a very interesting language.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 2: Complex Predicates with のだ
/// The underlying notion of the use of の (or ん in more casual conversation) and the copula だ in complex predicates gives the sense that the statement or question includes the speaker’s personal interpretation.

/// (1) In questions - it indicates that the speaker would like to confirm his or her understanding of a certain situation with the addressee.
/// Situation 1
/// な must be used between a nominal element and の（ん）だ.

天ぷらが好きなんですか。//I guess you like tempura, don’t you?

/// Situation 2
/// When の（ん）だ is used with an information-seeking question, it indicates that the speaker would like to receive some kind of explanation.

どこへ行くんですか。//Would you tell me where you’re going?

どこに行きますか。//Where are you going?

/// Situation 3
/// confirm the observation and at the same time convey that he or she would like some kind of explanation from the addressee

何があったんですか。//Tell me, what happened?
何かあったんですか。//Did something happen? – Tell me.
どうしたんですか。//Tell me what happened. Is something wrong?

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (2) In statements
/// When の（ん）だ is added to the predicate of a statement, it adds the sense that the speaker is giving an explanation of a past or future action. 

来年、日本に行きたいと思っているのですが、お金がありません。//You may know that I’d like to go to Japan next year, but I don’t have any money.
来年、日本に行きたいのですが、どの学校がいいでしょうか。//I’d like to go to Japan next year. What school do you think is good?

/// This complex predicate may also be used both in a why-question and its response in conversation.

どうして、授業を休んだんですか。//Tell me why you were absent from the class.
頭が痛かったんです。//It was because I had a headache.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 3: Complex Predicates with そうだ -> used to objectively report information that the speaker has gathered.

午後、雨が降るそうです。//My source tells me that it will rain this afternoon.
あの店のお茶はおいしいそうです。//I’ve heard/read/learned that tea at that shop is delicious.

/// The copula だ needs to be used between a noun or an adjectival noun and そう.

ここは静かだそうです。//I’ve heard/read/learned that this place is quiet.
あの人は日本人だそうです。//I’ve heard/read/learned that that person is Japanese.

/// (1) Information source -> in sentences with そうだ may be marked by によると.

テレビによると、今日は雨が降るそうです。//According to the TV, it’s going to rain today.
林さんの話によると、去年、東京は雪が降ったそうです。//According to Hayashi-san, it snowed in Tokyo last year.

/// (2) Complex predicates with そうだ and quotative sentences with 聞（き）く
/// the information is conveyed is clearer in the construction with 聞（き）いた.
/// The construction with そうだ does not clarify whether the information was “read,” “heard,” or received in some other way, unless he source is identified.
/// the topic of the predicate 聞（き）く is the person who hears the content; however, the topic of the predicate そうだ is not the person who has the information, but the thing or the person that the predicate describes.

午後、雨が降ると聞きました。//I heard that it would rain in the afternoon.
あの人は日本人だと聞きました。//I heard that that person is Japanese.

/// the complex predicate そうだ cannot express the specific time at which the information was obtained, but with the predicate 聞（き）く this is possible.

家に帰った時に、弟が日本に留学をすると聞いた。//When I went home, I heard that my brother was going to study abroad in Japan.

/// (3) Two different そう - the complex adjectival noun with そう and the complex predicate with そう（だ） have almost opposite meanings in terms of the information source

このケーキはおいしそうですね。//This cake looks delicious!
このケーキはおいしいそうですね。//I hear that this cake is delicious.

/// The first sentence is uttered based on the speaker’s direct and immediate observation, while the second sentence is based on an outside source

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 4: Conjunctive Forms and Other Verbs
/// There are predicates that consist of two verbs, the first of which is in the conjunctive form. This kind of predicate is quite different from a complex predicate, the biggest distinction being that the speaker’s views are not relevant in these predicates.

/// (1) ~てくる (て来る) and ~ていく (て行く)
/// The verb くる to indicate returning -> くる is used after another verb, it indicates that the speaker will return as soon as the event expressed by the first verb is complete.

コーヒーを買います。//I’ll buy some coffee.
コーヒーを買ってきます。//I’ll go and get some coffee.

走ってきました。//I went running, but I’m back now.

何をしたんですか。//Tell me what you did.
コーヒーを買ったんです。//I bought coffee.

どこに行ったんですか。//Tell me where you’ve been.
コーヒーを買ってきたんです。//I just went out to get coffee.

/// Verbs くる and いく to indicate the beginning of an event
/// くる and いく indicate the direction of movement. Since くる (来る) describes the topic approaching the speaker, it sometimes expresses the beginning of an event.

雨が降ってきました。//It’s started raining.
晴れてきました。//It’s beginning to clear up.
曇ってきました。//It’s starting to cloud over.

/// the combination of the verbs 出（で）る and いく gives the sense that the topic is moving away from the speaker.

ルームメートが明日ここから出ていきます。//My roommate is moving away tomorrow.

/// Metaphorical meanings - the directional verbs くる and いく can also be used to describe something moving metaphorically towards or away from the speaker.

分かってきました。//I’m beginning to understand.

日本語を忘れていきます。//I’m starting to forget Japanese.

/// (2) ~ておく - The verb 置（お）く, which means “to place something somewhere,”

私は鞄を机の上に置きました。//I put my backpack on the desk.

/// When this verb is combined in a predicate with another verb, it implies that the action will result in a benefit at a later time.

明日、パーティーがありますから、今日、食べ物と飲み物を買っておきました。//We’re having a party tomorrow, so I bought food and drinks for it today.
金曜日に試験がありますから、よく勉強しておいてください。//We’ll have an exam on Friday, so study the material well.
