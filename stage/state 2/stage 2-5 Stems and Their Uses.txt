stage ２，５。
/// Stage 2-5 Stems and Their Uses
/// 1: Nominal Elements of Stems
/// (1) About stems
/// # Stem formation
/// To review the rules for deriving stems from base forms, see Stage 1–9.

/// # The polite form as an example
/// See Stage 1–9 for information on the formation of polite forms with stems.

/// (2) Stems as nouns
/// When used alone, a stem may function as a noun, although not all stems can be used as nouns.
/// The following examples are typical:
/// Base form: 話す Stem: はなし Meaning as a noun: story; talk
/// Base form: 休む Stem: やすみ Meaning as a noun: vacation; time off
/// Base form: 読む Stem: よみ Meaning as a noun: reading

あの先生の話はいつも面白いです。//That teacher’s stories are always interesting.
明日、日本語の授業は休みです。//There will be no Japanese class tomorrow.
この漢字は音読みが二つと訓読みが一つあります。//This kanji has two on-readings and one kun-reading.

/// Please note that a stem used as a noun is different from a nominalized verb.
/// A nominalized verb with こと or の still maintains a verbal meaning, while a stem used as a noun does not.
/// Compare the following two sentences.

大学の夏休みは長いですねえ。//The college summer vacation is long, isn’t it?
忙しい時に、時々、休むことは大切です。//It’s important to rest sometimes when things are busy.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (3) Stems used to describe the weather
/// Weather may be described by using nouns such as 雨（あめ） and 雪（ゆき）, as shown below:

今日は雨です。//It is rainy today.
明日は雪です。//It will snow tomorrow.

/// To describe clear and cloudy days, it is common to use the stems of the relevant verbs in the predicate position.
/// 晴（は）れる is a verb meaning “to clear up.” 晴（は）れ is the stem of this verb.

今日は晴れです。//It is sunny today.

/// Likewise, 曇（くも）る is a verb that means “to become cloudy.” 曇（くも）り is the stem of this verb.

今日は曇りです。//It is cloudy today.

/// The following formulaic expression is often used by weather forecasters, and may be heard in weather reports.
/// It is good to know this expression in order to understand TV or radio broadcasts, but there is no need to use it to describe the weather in conversation.
/// 後（のち）, a rather formal word, means “later.”

今日は、晴れ、後、曇りです。//It will be clear at first and then cloud over later today.

/// In conversation, 後（あと）で “at a later time,” with the optional で, may be used rather than 後（の ち）:

今日は、晴れで、その後（で）、曇りになると聞きました。//I heard that today will be clear at first, and then it will cloud over.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (4) Responding to alternative questions with verbal predicates
/// There are three possible ways to respond to an alternative question:
/// 1. choose one of the options;
/// 2. choose both options;
/// 3. negate both options.

今日、勉強しましたか、（それとも）仕事しましたか。//Did you study or work today?

/// When choosing one of the options, state that option, as in the following:

仕事しました。//I worked.

/// When choosing both, use the following structure, in which the two nouns are used in the object positions:

勉強も仕事もしました。//I studied and worked.

/// If choosing neither option, use the following structure:

勉強も仕事もしませんでした。//I didn’t study or work.

/// The verbs in the above alternative question sentence contain the same verb する.
/// The following question sentence, however, contains two different verbs:

歩きましたか、走りましたか。//Did you walk or run?

/// In this case, to negate both alternatives, use the stems (which are nouns in form) marked by も with the negative form of the verb する.

歩きも走りもしませんでした。//I neither walked nor ran.

/// For choosing or negating both options, the pronoun どちらも “both” or “neither” may be used, regardless of the verbs used in the alternative question.
/// In this case, the verb する represents all verbs.

どちらもしませんでした。//I neither walked nor ran.
どちらもしました。//I did both.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 2: Stems with に as Purpose Phrases
/// (1) Purpose particle に
/// The particle に has many functions, as has already been shown.
/// In the following phrases, に functions to express the purpose of an action:

朝ご飯にりんごを食べます。//I eat apples for breakfast.
買い物に行きます。//I’m going shopping.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (2) Purpose of going somewhere
/// the stem of a verb is used with the purpose particle に to express a certain action as a purpose.
/// In this construction, the last verb must be a directional verb that indicates a movement from one place to another, such as coming or going somewhere, or returning home.

映画を見に行きましょう。//Let’s go see a movie.
友達に会いにこのレストランに来ました。//I came to this restaurant to meet my friend.
お昼ご飯をたたべに家に帰りました。//I went home to eat lunch.

/// When the main verb is not a directional verb, a different construction must be used, as explained in the following section.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (3) Purpose of doing something
/// When the main verb is one that does not indicate direction, such as “studying in order to become a teacher,” or “eating to gain weight,” then the purpose of the action should be expressed by the imperfective form of the verb followed by ために.

来年、留学するために、今年、日本語を勉強しています。//I am studying Japanese this year in order to study abroad next year.
友達と話すために、電話しました。//I called my friend on the phone in order to talk to him.

/// In fact, ために can be used for all verb types, even those that indicate direction.

すしを食べるために町に行きます。//I will go to town to eat sushi.

/// When both structures are possible, the purpose expressed by ために sounds more serious.

友達に話しに行きました。//I went to have a chat with my friend.
友達に話すために行きました。//I went to discuss something with my friend.

/// When the verb preceding ために is in the perfective form, the entire sentence takes on a different meaning.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (4) 大和言葉（やまとことば） and 漢語（かんご）
/// In addition to the use of a stem as a nominal form, one may see an actual noun that consists of kanji compounds in the same construction.
/// As explained thus far, both stems and nominalized verbs function as nominal elements.
/// In addition to these two kinds of nominal elements, there is another group of nouns that consist of more than one kanji.
/// These kanji compounds are called 漢語（かんご）.

/// For instance, the noun 読書（どくしょ） “reading,” a 漢語（かんご）.
/// The same meaning can be expressed by the verb 読む with the nominalizer こと, as in 読むこと.

/// In the pair of sentences below, 食（た）べ is derived from the verb 食べる, while the noun 食事（しょ くじ） “meal” is expressed with two kanji.
/// This kanji compound is pronounced with the on-reading:

明日、一緒に食べに行きませんか。//Would you like to eat together tomorrow?
明日、一緒に食事に行きませんか。//Would you like to eat together tomorrow?

/// In any language, there is often more than one word to refer to the same thing, event, action, state, etc.
/// In English, these similar words, if not exactly the same, may have different origins: AngloSaxon and Latin/French-based, for example.
/// In Japanese, two common sources are native words and Chinese words.
/// The native words are referred to as 大和言葉（やまとことば） or 和語（わご） while words of Chinese origin are 漢語（かんご）.
/// For “reading,” 読む is 大和言葉（やまとことば）, while the kanji compound 読書（どくしょ） is of Chinese origin.

/// Not all 漢語（かんご） are of Chinese origin, however.
/// For instance, the verb 食（た）べる is 大和言葉 （やまとことば）.
/// The 漢語 equivalent is 食事（しょくじ）する, but this 漢語（かんご） is a Japan-made noun based on the structure of the words of Chinese origin.
/// There are quite a few such 漢語.

/// Notice the differences in the readings of the kanji of these two words.
/// For most 大和言葉（やまとこ とば）, 訓読（くんよ）み is used, as in 食（た）べる.
/// And 音読（おんよ）み is used for most 漢語（かんご） as in 食事（しょくじ）.

/// The difference between the two kinds of words is often one of formality.
/// 大和言葉（やまとことば） are used more often in everyday speech, while 漢語（かんご） sound somewhat more formal.
/// Of course, this is just a broad generalization, and there are exceptions to this statement.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 3: Emotive Expressions
/// (1) Stem with たい
/// the construction of the stem with the suffix ~たい was introduced.

明日、映画に行きたいです。//I want to go to a movie tomorrow.

/// # Expressing one’s own desires
/// In Japanese culture, it is considered overly direct to express one’s own desires, so it may not be appropriate to use the たい-form by itself in some cases.
/// To avoid such directness, many speakers add the verb 思（おも）う.

来年、日本に行きたいと思っています。//I want to go to Japan next year.

/// Since the above sentence refers to the speaker’s current feeling, 思（おも）っている is better than the habitual 思（おも）う, which is generally used to express the speaker’s opinions.

/// There is no need to add 思（おも）う when negating a desire or talking about a past desire.

そんな映画は見たくありません。//I don’t want to see that kind of a movie.
ミルクが飲みたかったです。//I wanted to drink milk.

/// # Other facts
/// Other important facts to remember about this construction include the following
/// - The new forms are adjectives, as the last syllable い suggests;
/// - The object should be formally marked by the particle が, but in actual conversation を is also used;
/// - This expression can be used to express the speaker’s desire, or in a question addressing a second person directly, but it may not be used to talk about a third person’s desire.

/// # A third person’s emotive expressions
/// As the last point in the above list states, certain emotive expressions may not be used to describe a third person’s emotive states.

/// There are many ways to talk about a third person’s desire.
/// One is for the speaker to report what the third person said regarding his or her feelings.

マイクさんは来年、日本に行きたいと言いました。//Mike-san said that he wanted to go to Japan next year.

/// Another way is for the speaker to express his or her inference based on direct observation by using a complex predicate with ようだ.

マイクさんは来年、日本に行きたいようです。//It seems to me that Mike wants to go to Japan next year.

/// Review and further study of structures with the verbs 言（い）う (or おっしゃる) and 思（おも）う follows below.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (2) The verbs 言（い）う and おっしゃる
/// おっしゃる is the honorific verb of the verb 言（い）う.
/// The polite form is おっしゃいます, rather than お っしゃります, just as the polite form of いらっしゃる is いらっしゃいます, not いらっしゃります.

/// Since おっしゃる is the honorific verb of 言（い）う, it is used when the topic is someone to whom the speaker wishes to show respect.

/// With these verbs, there are essentially two ways to report what the other has said: the speech can be reported directly, or indirectly.

/// # Direct quotation
/// In reporting speech directly, the speaker repeats exactly what another person has said.
/// In the direct quote, such things as the predicate style (polite vs. plain), the predicate ending, and sentence-final particles may also be reported directly.
/// When speaking, it is really up to the speaker to choose what to include in the quote.
/// When reporting in writing, use quotation marks.
/// In horizontal writing, 「 is used to open a quote, and 」 is used to close it.
/// The direction of the quotation marks changes when writing vertically.

伊藤さんは「このケーキはおいしいですよ。」と言いました。//Ito-san said, ‘You know, this cake is delicious.’
鈴木先生は「試験は金曜日です。」とおっしゃいました。//Suzuki-sensei said, ‘The examination will be on Friday.’

/// # Indirect quotation
/// In an indirect quote, a speaker’s remarks are paraphrased rather than being quoted verbatim.
/// In this case, the content of the quote is expressed in the plain form, even though the person being quoted might have used the polite form.
/// Such things as sentence-final particles are not included in the indirect quote.

ジョンさんはこのケーキはおいしいと言いました。//John said that this cake was delicious.

/// With an adjectival predicate, as above, as well as with a verbal predicate, the copula is not needed for an indirect quote.
/// When the predicate is nominal, as below, the copula is needed to indicate aspect:

伊藤先生は試験は金曜日だとおっしゃいました。//Ito-sensei said that the examination would be on Friday.
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (3) The verb 思（おも）う
/// Both 思（おも）う and 考（かんが）える are translated as “to think.”
/// However, 思（おも）う, rather than 考 （かんが）える, is used for stating the speaker’s own opinions or thoughts.
/// 考（かんが）える is usually reserved for the problem-solving type of thinking.

/// The verb 思（おも）う is used similarly to the verb 言（い）う.
/// however, the verb 思（おも）う, is not used to quote thoughts directly.
/// Thoughts are generally conveyed by stating their content, rather than the verbatim thoughts themselves.

/// This verb can be used when the speaker asks the addressee what he or she thinks directly, or when the speaker expresses his or her thoughts.
/// Like other emotive expressions, this verb may not be used to express a third person’s thoughts.

/// When asking for opinions, use the interrogative pronoun どう rather than 何（なん）.

あなたはこれについてどう思いますか。//What do you think of this?
とてもいい考えだと思います。//I think it’s a very good idea.

/// When asking for specific information, 何（なん） or 何（なん） with an appropriate suffix may be used.
/// In this case, the question particle か is not used within the embedded question (that is, the question clause used within the sentence).
/// In the sentence below, か should not be used between the clause 何人だ and the final verb 思（おも）う.

あの人は何人だと思いますか。//What nationality do you think that person is?
あの人は日本人だと思います。//I think he’s Japanese.

/// As mentioned above, the topic of the verb 思（おも）う is always the speaker in a statement sentence, or the addressee in a question sentence.
/// This verb may not be used to report a third person’s opinion. To do this, another element such as 言（い）う or よう may be used after the verb 思（おも）う, as shown below.

鈴木さんはそれはいい考えだと思うと言いました。//Suzuki-san said that he thought it was a good idea.
鈴木さんはそれはいい考えだと思っているようです。//It looks to me like Suzuki-san thinks it’s a good idea.

/// (4) The verb 聞（き）く
/// The verb 聞（き）く has two different meanings.

/// # 聞（き）く “to hear”
/// It is most common to use indirect quotation to express something that has been heard from another person.

伊藤先生の授業はとても難しいと聞きました。//I heard that Ito-sensei’s class is very difficult.
伊藤先生の授業はとても難しいということを聞きました。//I heard that Ito-sensei’s class is very difficult.

/// To convey what has been heard directly, the two verbs, 言（い）う and 聞（き）く, must be used in a single sentence. This type of sentence will be covered in Stage 3–1, as the important factor of direct perception must be considered.

/// # 聞（き）く “to ask”
/// There are direct as well as indirect ways to report the content of a question.
/// When reporting directly, both か in the quoted question and と, which connects the quote and the verb 聞（き）く, are used.
/// When reporting indirectly, the question particle かoverrides the quotative particle と.

鈴木先生は僕に「何時に起きましたか。」と聞きました。//Suzuki-sensei asked me, ‘What time did you get up?’
鈴木先生は僕に何時に起きたか聞きました。//Suzuki-sensei asked me what time I got up.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// 4: Two Simultaneous Events
/// (1) Stem with ながら
/// The stem of an action verb with ながら is used as an adverbial phrase to express an action that accompanies a main action, but only as performed by a single person.

私はいつも新聞を読みながら、勉強します。//I always read the newspaper while I’m studying.

/// In the sentence above, the main action—studying—is described in the main clause.
/// The other action, reading the newspaper, is the accompanying action.

/// The main action in the English sentence can be expressed after the word “while” (as in the translated sentence above).
/// In Japanese, the function of the stem with ながら is adverbial, so it must be given before the thing it modifies (the main clause).

/// Aspects such as negation and time are all expressed in the main clause.

テレビを見ながら、勉強しないでください。//Please don’t watch TV while you study.
昨日、メールを読みながら、朝ご飯を食べました。//I read my e-mail while I ate breakfast yesterday.

/// The ながら-construction has the following restrictions:
/// - The ながら-construction may not be used to express an event in which two different people do two different things simultaneously (e.g., “I always read the newspaper while my mother watches TV”).
/// - Neither verb in the ながら-construction can be a stative (non-action) verb (e.g., “I got married while I was in Japan”).
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
/// (2) The clausal conjunction あいだ（に）
/// Complex sentences joined by the conjunction あいだ（に） may be used in the two situations described above, where the construction with ながら is not possible.
/// The conjunction あいだ may be written in kanji as 間, or in hiragana; both are acceptable.

/// The construction with あいだ（に） may be used for the actions of a single person or those of two different people.
/// It may also be used to express simultaneous continuous actions, state events, or punctual actions.
/// The use of に is not optional. See the next section for the meaning differences between the sentences with and without に.

/// In the first example below, that the complex sentence joined by あいだ（に） is used to express events happening with two different people simultaneously.
/// The second example shows that the predicate within the adverbial clause may be stative.
/// It would not be possible to use ながら in either of these cases.

子供が寝ているあいだ（に）、私は勉強しました。//I studied during the time that my child was sleeping.
私は日本にいるあいだ（に）、漢字をたくさん勉強しました。//I studied a lot of kanji during the time I was in Japan.

/// # The use of に after あいだ
/// The particle に in あいだに is not optional.
/// When the particle に is used immediately after 間（あい だ）, it indicates that the duration of the events in the two clauses is not the same.

子供が寝ている間に、私は勉強しました。//I studied for part of the time that my child was sleeping.

/// When no に is used, it indicates that the duration of the events in the two clauses is the same.

子供が寝ている間、私は勉強しました。//I studied while my child was sleeping.

/// When the action within the main clause is punctual (non-continuous), に is obligatory.

私は日本にいる間に、彼に会いました。//I met him while I was in Japan.

/// # Predicate forms in the あいだ-clause
/// Because predicate forms in the あいだ-clause are normally durational, the aspect of the adverbial clause does not have to be in the perfective form even for the past events.

私が病気の間、あの人は手伝ってくださいました。//That person helped me during the time I was sick.
部屋が静かな間に、勉強しました。//I studied while the room was quiet.
子供が寝ているあいだに、勉強しました。//I studied while my child was asleep.

カンバセーション。

/// (1) Where does this bus go?

すみません。このバス、どこ行きですか。//Excuse me. Where does this bus go?
大阪行きです。//To Osaka.
京都行きはどこから出てますか。//Where does the bus to Kyoto leave from?

/// # どこ行き
/// The stem of 行く is used to specify destination in a rather unusual structure.
/// When asking about a destination, it is used within the predicate in a complex noun, どこ行（ゆ）き, with no intervening particle.
/// The stem 行き may be pronounced either いき or ゆき; ゆき is very common in this context.

/// (2) Expressing regret

ああ、どうしよう？やっぱり、試験、全然、だめだった！//What am I going to do? I knew this would happen . . . I totally messed up my exam!
僕も、あの試験、難しかったと思うよ。//I thought the exam was hard, too.
でも、昨日、私、音楽、聞きながら勉強してたから、私がいけないんだと思う。//But, it’s my fault . . . I listened to music the whole time I was studying yesterday.

/// # どうしよう？
/// This is a casual version of どうしましょうか, “What should I do?” It is important to remember that ど う, rather than なん, is used for this expression.

/// # やっぱり
/// This adverb is used when the speaker wants to express that the situation is what he or she has expected.
/// やっぱり is more casual than やはり.

/// # 私がいけないんです
/// 私がいけない is an idiomatic expression that means “I am the one who should be blamed.”
/// ~んで す expresses that the speaker is trying to convince the addressee that it is his or her fault.

/// (3) A great help

どうしよう？電車の時間に間に合わないと思います。//What shall I do? I don’t think I can make it to the train in time.
大丈夫ですよ。僕の車で駅まで行きましょう。//It’ll be fine. Let’s go to the station in my car.
ええ？いいんですか。ありがとうございます。本当に助かります。//Really? Are you sure? Thank you so much. What a great help!

/// 間（ま）に合（あ）わない is the negative form of the idiomatic phrase, 間（ま）に合（あ）う “to be on time.”

/// # いいんですか
/// This expression is equivalent to an expression in English, “Are you sure that’s all right?” ~んです か indicates that the speaker wants to confirm his or her assumption or understanding.

/// # 本当に助（たす）かります
/// 助（たす）かる is an intransitive verb indicating that “something is helpful to the situation that the person is in at the moment.”
/// When someone volunteers to help, this is an appropriate expression to use together with ありがとうございます in two separate sentences.
