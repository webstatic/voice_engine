/// Stage 3-2 Making Inferences
/// 1: Complex Predicates with そうだ
/// (1) Overview
/// Complex predicates with such elements as そうだ, ようだ, and らしい express the speaker’s inferences based on different sources.
/// Some of these have been already introduced, and some are new.

/// The difference among the structures that express inferences lies in the source of information:
/// whether it is from an objective or subjective source, or the degree of objectivity or subjectivity of the information source.

/// The following illustrates the continuum of different information sources of the relevant elements of these structures.

/// Objective source ———————-———————— Subjective source
/// そうだ らしい                      ようだ Stem + そう

/// Often, English expressions such as “it appears,” “it looks,” “it seems,” or “it is likely” are used to introduce complex predicate structures with the above elements.
/// A reminder here is that there is no absolute one-to-one correspondence between certain English translations and Japanese sentences (or vice versa),
/// so it is important to remember that learning the underlying meaning of each structure is far more powerful than learning structures via English translation.

/// (2) Complex words with そう and complex predicates with そうだ
/// They look similar, but the information sources, as well as the structures, are quite different. Review the following.

/// A complex adjectival noun is derived by adding そう to the stem of a word, while a complex predicate is derived by adding そうだ to the original predicate.
/// The meanings are quite different.

あの人の作ったケーキはまずそうですね。//The cake that he made doesn’t look very appetizing, does it?
あの人の作ったケーキはまずいそうですね。//I heard that the cake that he made is unappetizing; is that right?

/// # Information source
/// the objective information source is often expressed with によると and a complex predicate with そうだ.
/// However, the objective source cannot be expressed by the complex adjectival noun with そう.
/// This complex word is used only for information sources that are completely subjective.

山田さんの話によると、あの人の作ったケーキはまずいそうですね。//According to Yamada-san, the cake that he made is unappetizing, but is that really so?

/// (3) Aspects of the two structures
/// The following sentences illustrate how aspects of the above two structures are expressed:
