stage ３，７。
/// Stage 3-7 Requests, Commands, and Imperatives

/// 1: Imperative Forms and Sentences
/// (1) Terms
/// The terms “request,” “command,” and “imperative” are very close in meaning.
/// The functions defined by these terms, and the structures that convey them, are only generally correlated;
/// there is really no definite one-to-one correspondence between them.
/// It is true that certain constructions are suitable for certain functions,
/// but in any language, different structures may be used for the same content, depending on the situation.

/// This chapter attempts to show that different structures may be used for a single function, and, likewise, that a single structure can be used for many different functions.
/// It is therefore very important to be able to recognize the importance of appropriate judgment in using the right structure for the right situation.

/// # Making requests
/// In this, the term “request” is used when the speaker asks someone else to do something on his or her behalf.
/// Requests may be expressed by different types of sentences.
/// The following examples therefore are not exhaustive.

/// When requesting that the addressee do something for the speaker,
/// it is appropriate for the speaker to use ~てくださいませんか if the addressee is someone who is of a higher social status.

すみませんが、日曜日までにこの手紙を書いてくださいませんか。//I’m sorry to ask you this, but could you please write this letter by Sunday?

/// When asking the same thing of someone who is senior to the speaker, but only slightly so (e.g., a senpai in a social club),
/// then the following may be more appropriate:

すみませんが、日曜日までにこの手紙を書いてくれませんか。//I’m sorry to ask you this, but can you write this letter by Sunday?

/// For a request to a close friend, the use of ~てくれない in the rising tone is sufficient.
/// In this case, the use of すみませんが is too polite.

悪いけど、日曜日までにこの手紙を書いてくれない？//Sorry, but can you write this letter by Sunday?

/// A person may ask her or his friend to do something by using the て-form of a verb alone;
/// the use of the conjunctive form here does not have to be interpreted as a command, as one might expect, especially when some confirmation of the previous agreement is added.
/// Here the use of the sentence-final particle ね functions as confirmation.

悪いけど、日曜日までにこの手紙を書いてね。//Sorry, but I need you to write this by Sunday.

/// Although colloquial, ~てちょうだい may be used as a request from an authority figure to an addressee.
/// This expression is not as polite as ~てください and should not be used as a public command.
/// For instance, a mother speaking to a child may use this expression to make a request.

これ、ちょっと読んでちょうだい。//Read this for me.

/// Many other structures may be used to make requests, as well.
/// Other options will be presented in a later part of this chapter, when issues related to politeness are discussed.

/// # Making commands
/// A “command” is used when an individual with greater authority tells the addressee what to do.
/// For instance, a teacher gives commands to his or her students, as shown below.
/// Even though the teacher is addressing children, she or he uses ください.
/// This indicates that this speech is made in a public place such as a school.

この宿題は来週、出してください。//Please submit this homework next week.

/// In a person-to-person interaction, even if it is a teacher speaking to a student, くださいmay be dropped.
/// For instance, when a teacher is explaining to a single student when assignments should be submitted, the following sentence may be used.
/// The speaker’s intent is conveyed through the sentence-final particle.
/// In the sentence below, the use of ね confirms the addressee’s understanding;
/// the use of よ suggests that the speaker wants to make sure that the addressee understands his or her duty.

この宿題は来週、出してね。//Submit this homework next week.
/// ね or よ

/// A stem with なさい may also be used to give a command (see Stage 2–6).
/// For instance, an elementary school teacher may give a command to a pupil using this construction.
/// This type of sentence can be used by a mother or a father to her or his child as well.
/// Depending on the situation and the tone used, this construction may be used to give an order or a strong command.

この宿題は来週、出しなさい。//Submit this homework next week.

/// The colloquial ~てちょうだい may also be used as a command in appropriate situations.
/// See above for an example.

/// # Giving instructions
/// Giving instructions is a form of giving a command.
/// The only difference between the two is the position of the speaker.
/// When giving instructions, the speaker does not have to be someone who has authority, but is the person who has the information in a certain social setting.
/// For instance, a receptionist could give directions to a customer as follows:

こちらにお座りください。//Please sit here.

/// As pointed out in Stage 2–6, written instructions for a test, for instance, are expressed by a stem with なさい.
/// One may also see ~てください in such an instruction as well.
/// In this case, a stem with なさい lends a more authoritative ring to the instruction.

この言葉を漢字で書きなさい。//Write this word in kanji.
この言葉を漢字で書いてください。//Write this word in kanji.

/// For giving directions to a taxi driver, ~てください is common;
/// using a stem with なさい would be inappropriate.

/// As is the case for request sentences, many other structures may be used for commands and giving instructions.
/// These will be presented and summarized in a later part of this chapter, with a special focus on issues related to politeness.

/// (2) Imperative forms
/// An imperative, a stronger form of command, is used when the speaker is ordering the addressee to do something in a very strong manner.
/// One way to express imperatives is by using imperative verb forms.

/// # Positive imperative forms
/// The following chart shows the rules of deriving imperative forms from base forms.
/// Stative verbs such as ある and いる, some honorific verbs, and some intransitive counterparts of transitive-intransitive pairs lack imperative forms because of their meanings.

/// Group 1: Change る to ろ
///     くれる → くれ（ろ）; normally ろ is dropped for this verb.
/// Group 2: Change the last u to e
/// Group 3: する → しろ, くる → こい

/// - Ex
/// G1: たべる → たべろ, みる → みろ
/// G2: かく → かけ, はなす → はなせ, かう → かえ

/// # Negative imperatives
/// The negative imperative forms are made by adding な to the positive imperfective form.
/// たべるな, のむな, いくな, するな, くるな

/// (3) Direct imperatives
/// When an imperative form is used alone to make a direct order, the expression sounds extremely harsh and direct.
/// Only a limited number of situations allow such a use.
/// An example could be when a senior member, most likely male, of a sports club is training a junior member:

走れ！//Run!
止まるな！//Don’t stop!

/// An older brother might say to his little brother:

黙れ！//Be quiet!
泣くな！//Don’t cry!

/// When a sentence-final particle is added to the imperative forms, the expression may not sound so harsh, especially with a falling intonation.
/// With a harsher tone of voice, the sentence could still sound quite rude and punitive.
/// In either case, however, this is used only by male speakers.

だれにも言うなよ。//Don’t tell anyone this.
食べろよ。//Eat, will you?

/// What would a female speaker say in these situations?
/// For positive imperatives, using ~て alone or ~ てちょうだい, and for negative imperatives, using ~ないで or ~ないでちょうだい with appropriate sentence-final particles is common.

黙って（ちょうだい）！//Be quiet!
泣かないで（ちょうだい）！//Don’t cry!

/// # Fixed expressions
/// Some fixed expressions in the imperative form may be used by both genders.
/// The following expression is used to give encouragement, not an order.
/// It may be repeated for emphasis.

頑張れ！頑張れ！//You can do it!
/// or “Good luck!

/// The same content can be expressed by the て-form alone as well.
/// The following expression sounds a little milder than the one with the imperative form.

頑張って！//You can do it!
/// or “Good luck!”

/// (4) Embedded imperative forms
/// Embedded imperative forms are often used to convey what someone was told by someone else.
/// For example, they may be used to express how the speaker was told to do or not do certain things.
/// In such a situation, what the speaker was told can be expressed with the imperative form, even if the imperative form was not actually used in the original statement.
/// Gender need not be considered when imperative forms are used in embedded clauses.

僕は父に早く帰れと言われました。//My father said to come home soon.
/// Literally, “I was told by my father to come home soon.”

私はいつも母にそんなに急いで食べるなと言われます。//My mother always tells me not to eat so fast.
/// Literally, “I am always told by my mother not to eat in a hurry.”

/// (5) Imperfective verbs with ように
/// Sentences containing the imperative form of a verb, even within embedded clauses, may still sound quite direct and strong.
/// For a softer approach, the following construction with ように may be used.
/// The verb preceding ように must be in the imperfective form.

/// # With positive verbs

大きな声で話すように言われました。//I was told to speak loudly.
来月までに終えるように頼まれました。//I was asked to finish it by next month.

/// # With negative verbs

森さんに来年まで退職しないように言っておきました。//I told Mori-san not to retire until next year.
日本語の勉強を諦めないように言ってください。//Please tell him not to give up on his Japanese studies.

/// 2: Structures for Giving Commands
/// In the above section, it was shown that a certain function, such as a “command,” can be expressed by different structures.
/// In this section, several different functions for which a single structure may be used will be presented.
/// Typical structures for giving a command, such as ~て（ください） and ~て（ち ょうだい）, will not be included here.

/// (1) Stem + なさい

/// # Giving commands to children
/// As explained above, the stem with なさい is used to give a direct command;
/// it is often used by parents to their children, older siblings to younger siblings, or by teachers, especially those of younger children, to their pupils.

早く寝なさい。//Go to bed early.
もっと、野菜を食べなさい。//Eat more vegetables.

/// # Giving instructions
/// The stem with なさい is also used to give written instructions, especially in tests and examinations.

この文を日本語に訳しなさい。//Translate this sentence into Japanese.

/// For other instructions, such as those written in manuals or driving directions, this construction is not suitable.
/// ~てください is better to use for these purposes.

/// (2) ~てはいけない（だめ）

/// # Prohibition
/// The stem with なさい has no negative counterpart.
/// To express this concept, one of the previously introduced constructions used for prohibition, ~てはいけない or ~てはだめ, may be used.

ここで走っては、いけません。//Running is not allowed here.
ここで走っては、だめです。//It’s not a good idea to run here.

/// Of course, a negative command, both polite and casual, with ないで is also possible:

ここで走らないでください。//Please don’t run here.
ここで走らないで。//Don’t run here.

/// # Casual speech, ~ちゃいけない（だめ）
/// Speech tends to be casual when children are being addressed.
/// In casual speech, many things that are not heard in formal speech may surface.
/// For instance, sentence-final particles are used much more frequently; these particles may differ depending on the speaker’s gender.
/// Predicate endings may also differ based on gender.
/// In addition, more contractions may occur in casual speech.

/// For instance, the following contractions were introduced in the Conversational Devices section of Stages 2–7 and 2–8:
/// ~てしまう → ~ちゃう, ~ておく → ~とく, and ~なければ → ~なきゃ.

忘れちゃった。//I totally forgot it.
ちゃんと買っとくから、心配しないで。//I’ll buy them, don’t worry.
宿題しなきゃ。//I have to do my homework.

/// In prohibitions, the ~ては of ~てはいけない or ~てはだめ (as well as other uses of ~ては) is contracted to ~ちゃ in casual speech.

そんなこと、言っちゃ、だめ。//You shouldn’t say things like that.

/// # Advice for children
/// The colloquial constructions ~ちゃいけない（だめ） may be used by an adult to give advice or suggestions to children.
/// The use of the copula at the end of the sentence is limited to male speakers.

授業、休んじゃ、だめだよ。//It’s not good to skip school; you know that, don’t you.

/// A female speaker would say the sentence above without the copula.

授業、休んじゃ、だめよ。//It’s not good to skip school; you know that, don’t you.
嘘、ついちゃ、だめよ。//You shouldn’t tell lies.
/// Literally, “It’s not good to tell lies.”

/// (3) お + stem
/// Orders using the honorific お with the stem are often given to animals.
お座り！//Sit!

/// Sometimes a much older person may give such a command to a much younger person,
/// but this usage is extremely restricted, and is used only by a certain type of person.
/// When this kind of construction is used, the speaker is either quite irritated or not very refined.

お食べ！//Eat!
お行き！//Go!

/// # Fixed expressions
/// Included in any construction are fixed expressions that may not carry all of the implications or meanings of the original construction;
/// the following command is one of these.
/// Most fixed phrases may be used with fewer restrictions.
/// The following command may be given by an adult to a child, for example, and it does not sound as harsh as those above.

お出で！//Come this way!

/// The fixed expression above comes from an honorific verb, お出（い）でになる.
/// This honorific verb is for both 行く and 来る, and お出（い）でになる is more honorific than the honorific いらっしゃる.
/// Because it is a fixed expression, however, the honorific implications are not conveyed in the expression above,
/// except in that it is less harsh than others using the same structure.

/// 3: Indirect Commands
/// Commands can be expressed directly or indirectly. The constructions discussed above are direct commands.
/// Commands can also be implied in some sentences. Some ways to express commands indirectly are introduced below.

/// (1) Complex predicates with ものだ

/// # もの as a noun
/// The noun 物 {もの} refers to tangible things or concepts (when used for concepts, もの is not normally written in kanji).
/// こと is often contrasted with 物, as both are translated as “things.”
/// For the difference between こと and 物, see Stage 2–2.
/// In the following sentences, the first 物 refers to a tangible thing, while the second もの refers to a concept.
 
あの大きい物は何ですか。//What is that big thing?
言葉というものは難しいものだ。//What we call language is a very difficult thing.

/// # Complex predicates with positive imperfectives
/// もの is also used as a functional noun in the complex predicate ものだ.
/// In this case, もの is not written in kanji.
/// This complex predicate expresses commonly expected modes of behavior (such as customs in a certain country).
/// Although the nuance is not as strong as a direct command or imperative, it still indicates a strong expectation.

/// A construction with a positive imperfective predicate before ものだ is used to convey behavior that the speaker believes is dictated by common sense.

人を訪ねる時は、いつもお土産を持っていくものだ。//When you visit someone, you should always bring a gift with you.
人から物をもらった時には、きちんとお礼を言うものです。//When you receive something from someone, you should politely thank him.

/// # Complex predicates with negative imperfectives
/// Either the copula or the verb immediately before ものだ may be negated.
/// By negating the copula, the speaker is pointing out the undesirable action that he or she has observed, thereby conveying the message that it should not be repeated.

そんな失礼なことを言うものではありません。//You shouldn’t say those kinds of rude things.
/// I.e., the person has made the rude statement already.

/// When the verb before ものだ is in the negative form, the speaker expects that the action will not take place.

親切にしてもらったら、文句を言わないものです。//Don’t complain when receiving such kindness.
/// I.e., the addressee is expected not to complain.

/// (2) Different meanings with positive perfectives
/// Indirect commands must be expressed with imperfectives.
/// If a perfective is used in the predicate before ものだ, the implication of an indirect command is absent.
/// Instead, the construction indicates that the action referred to is something the speaker used to do in the past.

僕はこの店でよくコーヒーを飲んだものだ。//I often used to drink coffee at this store.
子供の時、私はよくこの公園で遊んだものだった。//When I was a child, I used to play in this park.

/// The difference between the imperfective copula だ and perfective copula だった is slight.
/// The nuance that the event occurred quite a while ago is emphasized much more with だった,
/// but this is really a matter of the speaker’s or writer’s perspective.

/// (3) Complex predicates with べきだ
/// The complex predicate with べきだ expresses a strong obligation.
/// The use of べきだ in a complex predicate sounds very objective and impersonal compared with something like ~なければならない.
/// Because of this nuance, it is often used to talk about social expectations or obligations.
/// Note that the complex predicate with ものだ lacks the meaning of obligation.

先生に謝るべきです。//You should apologize to the teacher.
退職するべきです。//You should retire.

/// Negatives are only expressed in the copula, not in the predicate before べきだ.

どんなことがあっても、諦めるべきでは（じゃ）ありません。//One should never give up, no matter what.

/// # Controversial acts
/// The negative perfective of the copula in this construction can be used to indicate that a person has committed a controversial act.
/// The speaker judges that the act, which has already happened, should never have taken place.

あの人はこんな手紙を書くべきでは（じゃ）ありませんでした。//He really shouldn’t have written this kind of letter.

/// 4: Politeness Levels of Requests and Commands
/// Many structures can be used to express requests and commands.
/// In this section, they are summarized according to their level of politeness.

/// (1) Requests

/// # ~てくださいませんか
/// ~てくださいませんか is one of the most typical constructions introduced as a way to make requests.
/// As explained earlier, the sentence below may be used to request something of your teacher, a senior, or an older non-family member whom you are expected to respect.

推薦状を書いてくださいませんか。//Can you please write me a recommendation letter?

/// # ~てもらえませんか and ~ていただけませんか
/// もらえる and いただける in these constructions are the potential forms of もらう and いただく.
/// When these verbs are used to make requests, they should be used in the negative.
/// The literal meaning of this construction is something like “Wouldn’t it be possible for me to receive your doing such-and-such for me?”
/// Because of this circumlocution, these requests are much more polite than the one above.
/// They can be used to make requests of the same people addressed with ~てくださいませんか; these structures are simply more polite.

推薦状を書いてもらえませんか。//Could you please write me a recommendation letter?

/// Since いただく is the humble form of もらう, using this verb makes the expression even more polite than one with もらう:

推薦状を書いていただけませんか。//Would it be possible for you to write a recommendation letter for me?

/// Even more indirect, and thus more polite, is the use of the volitional copula でしょう, as in the following:

推薦状を書いてもらえないでしょうか。//Do you think it might be possible for you to write me a recommendation letter?
推薦状を書いていただけないでしょうか。//Do you think it might be possible for you to write a recommendation letter for me?

/// Further politeness can be obtained by changing もらえない and いただけない before でしょうか into the polite forms.

推薦状を書いてもらえませんでしょうか。//Is there any way that you might write me a recommendation letter?
推薦状を書いていただけませんでしょうか。//Is there any way that you might write a recommendation letter for me?

/// # Casual direct request with ~てくれる？~てくれない？
/// All of the above may be changed into the plain predicates.
/// These sentences may be used for making casual requests of friends or acquaintances.
/// When the negative form is used, it is more indirect, and thus more polite, than the positive ending.

これ、読んでくれる？//Can you read this for me?
これ、読んでくれない？//Could you read this for me?

/// # Casual indirect request with ~てもらえない？ ~ていただけない？
/// Even though the expression is still casual, the use of the potential with the receiving verbs もらう and いただく is more indirect and polite.
/// The use of いただく is more polite than もらう.

これ、読んでもらえない？//Could you please read this for me?
これ、読んでいただけない？//Could you please read this for me?

/// # ~てちょうだい
/// The colloquial spoken form ~てちょうだい may be used to ask children or others with less power to do something for the speaker.
/// On the politeness scale, this structure may be the most casual, at least of those compared in this section.

ちょっと、手伝ってちょうだい。//Give me a hand for a moment, will you?

/// (2) Commands
/// In all cases, regardless of its politeness level, a command is given from a person with more power to one with less power;
/// for instance, from a teacher to a student or from a senior member to a junior member of a group.

/// # Polite command with ~てください
/// Polite commands are used in more public situations, such as in a high school or a college classroom.

静かにしてください。//Please be quiet.

/// # Casual command with ~て
/// ください may be deleted when speaking to children or in a less formal situation.

ほら、静かにして。//Be quiet, you guys.

/// # Stem + なさい
/// This construction is often used to give commands to children or to students.

静かにしなさい。//Be quiet.

/// (3) Giving instructions

/// # お + stem + ください
/// A store clerk might use the following structure to tell a customer how to fill out an application form:

こちらにお名前とご住所をお書きください。//Write your name and address here.
こちらでお待ちください。//Please wait here.

/// # The use of ませ
/// In the above cases, ませ may be added to make the instructions more polite.

こちらにお名前とご住所をお書きくださいませ。//Please write your name and address here.
こちらでお待ちくださいませ。//Please wait here.

/// # Stem + なさい (written instructions)

これを日本語に訳しなさい。//Translate this into Japanese.
下線部を漢字に書きかえなさい。//Write the underlined parts in kanji.

/// Endings such as ませ are never used for test instructions, but ~てください may be used.

カンバセーション。

/// (1) My dad is so annoying

やれ、やれって、本当にうちの父はうるさいの。//My dad’s always telling me what to do; it’s so annoying.
どこの親も同じじゃない？//All parents are the same, aren’t they?
そうかしら？うちのは特にうるさいと思うんだけど。//Really? I think mine must be particularly annoying.
そんなことないよ。どこだって同じだよ。//I don’t think so. They’re all the same.

/// # やれ、やれって
/// やる is a casual verb meaning “to do.”
/// やれ is its imperative form.
/// When repeated, as above, the expression means something like, “Do this, do that!”

/// # うるさい
/// This adjective has the meaning of “noisy” in the literal sense, but it can also mean “annoying.”

/// # どこだって同じ {どこだって おなじ}
/// どこだって is a casual equivalent of どこでも.
/// So, the meaning of this phrase is “it’s the same everywhere.”

/// (2) Go ask him

このバス、どこ行きのバスですか。//Where does this bus go?
さあ、どこかな・・・ちょっと、分かんないから、あの黒い帽子かぶったおじさんに聞いてみて。//Hmm, I wonder . . . I don’t know. Why don’t you go ask that guy in the black hat?

/// # 分かんない
/// This is a casual way to say わからない. It is used often in casual conversation.

/// # おじさん
/// Family terms such as おじさん, おばさん, おじいさん, and おばあさん may be used to address strangers.
/// These terms may sound insulting to some individuals who are age-sensitive.
/// It is difficult to give definite guidelines as to when these terms are better avoided,
/// but when in doubt, either avoid them or use a “younger” term to address someone:
/// for example, おばさん rather than おばあさん and おじさ ん than おじいさん.

/// # (3) Being late
/// [Dialogue between two female speakers]

ごめんなさい、遅くなっちゃって！待ったでしょう？//I’m so sorry I’m late! I hope you haven’t been waiting long.
大丈夫よ、気にしなくても。会議は後、１５分ぐらいで始まるから。//No problem. Don’t worry. The meeting will begin in about 15 minutes.
そう、よかった。タクシーの方が早いからタクシーで行けって父に言われて、タクシーで来たんだけど、途中で交通事故があったみたいで、すごい渋滞だったの。//I’m glad, then. My dad told me it would be faster to take a taxi, but I think there was an accident on the way. The traffic was terrible.
それは、大変だったわね。でも、ちゃんと間に合って、よかったわねえ。//That’s too bad. But I’m glad you made it.

/// # 気にしなくても
/// In this expression, いい is omitted from 気にしなくてもいい (“You don’t have to worry about it”).

/// # 後、１５分ぐらいで
/// This phrase means “in about 15 minutes (things will begin).”

/// # 渋滞 {じゅうたい}
/// This word means “traffic jam.”
/// It is possible to combine it with 交通 {こうつう} “transportation,” as in 交通渋滞 {こうつうじゅうたい}, which also means “traffic jam.”
