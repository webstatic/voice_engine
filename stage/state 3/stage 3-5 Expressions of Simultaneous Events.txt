/// Stage 3-5 Expressions of Simultaneous Events

/// 1: Review of ながら and あいだ（に）
/// There are many structures that express two simultaneous events in Japanese.
/// Many of these constructions are equated with English sentences in which “while” functions as a connector.
/// Sentences expressing simultaneous events with ながら-phrases and あいだ（に）-clauses were introduced in Stage 2–5.
/// This chapter begins with a summary of the differences between these two structures and goes on to introduce new constructions that express similar concepts.

/// (1) Adverbial phrases with ながら
/// Adverbial phrases with ながら are used to express a secondary action that accompanies a main action when both are performed by the same person.

私はいつも新聞を読みながら、勉強します。//I always read newspapers while studying.

/// The ながら-adverbial phrase may not be used to describe simultaneous actions performed by different people, however.
/// In addition, if one of the predicates is stative, not active, the ながら-adverbial may not be used.

/// (2) Adverbial clauses with あいだ（に）
/// An adverbial clause with あいだ（に） may be used for simultaneous actions performed by the same person, or by different people.
/// It can also be used for continuous actions, stative events, and even punctual events.

/// In the following sentences, two different individuals are doing two different things at the same time.
/// When the action expressed in the main clause is shorter in duration than that in the adverbial clause, the particle に should be used immediately after あいだ.

子供が寝ている間、私は勉強しました。//I studied during the time that my child was sleeping.
子供が寝ている間に、私は勉強しました。//I studied for part of the time that my child was sleeping.

/// This construction can be used to express simultaneous states as well as simultaneous actions.

私は日本にいる間、漢字をたくさん勉強しました。//I studied a lot of kanji when I was in Japan.

/// 2: Simultaneous Events with Other Adverbials
/// (1) Adverbial clauses with うちに
/// The most salient feature of the structure in which clauses are connected with うちに is that the condition stated in the うち-clause is expected to change relatively soon.
/// うち comes from the noun うち “inside.”
/// The literal interpretation of the condition marked by うち is therefore something like “within the time that the condition holds true.”
/// あいだ-clauses do not have such an assumption regarding changes of condition.

お茶が熱いうちに、飲んで下さい。//Please drink the tea before it gets cold.
/// Literally, “while it’s still hot”

あの人がここにいるうちに、聞いておいた方がいいですよ。//You’d better ask him while he is still here.

/// Because change is a prominent factor in the うち-clause, negative predicates are often used in this clause.

雨が降らないうちに、家に帰りましょう。//Let’s go home before it starts raining.
/// Literally, “while it’s still not raining”

寒くならないうちに、部屋に入ってください。//Please go inside before it gets cold.
/// Literally, “while it’s not cold yet”

/// (2) Adverbial phrases with まま（で）
/// Like ながら-adverbials, adverbial phrases with まま are used to express two simultaneous events concerning the same person.
/// This structure cannot be used to discuss simultaneous events concerning different people.
/// The difference between the two structures is that the verb used in the まま-adverbial phrase must be punctual; that is, non-continuous, in nature.
/// In addition, the perfective form of the verb must be used immediately before まま in this phrase, because the phrase implies a state of completed action expressed by the verb.
/// で after まま is optional.

電車の中で立ったまま（で）、寝てしまいました。//I fell asleep standing on the train.
/// Literally, “I had stood up on the train, and in that state, I fell asleep.”

服を着たまま（で）、寝てしまいました。//I fell asleep with my clothes on.
/// Literally, “I had put my clothes on, and in that state, I fell asleep.”

めがねをかけたまま（で）、泳がないで下さい。//Please don’t swim with your glasses on.
/// Literally, “If you have put your glasses on and are still in that state, don’t swim.”

/// (3) ~ながら with stative verbs
/// ながら-phrases have two different functions.
/// The function introduced in Stage 2–5 describes a secondary action accompanying a main action.
/// The second function, which is introduced in this section, is similar to ~ても or のに.
/// In this case, the verb in the phrase with ~ながら must be stative.
/// Using ~ ながら in this way is quite formal.

あの人は、家にいながら、電話に出ないのは、変ですね。//It’s strange that he’s not answering the phone even though he’s home.
彼はお金がありながら、物を買うことが好きじゃないんですよ。//Hard to believe, but he doesn’t like to buy things, even though he has money.

/// With adjectives (including adjectival nouns) and adverbs, ながら is used immediately after the word.
/// That is, the form of an adjective does not change in this construction.

彼女は、小さいながら、とっても元気です。//Although she is small, she is very energetic.
あの人は、ゆっくりながら、日本語をとても上手に話します。//Although she speaks slowly, she speaks Japanese very well.

/// (4) Conjunctions （そのまま・そのうちに・そのあいだに）
/// The conjunctions used for adverbial clauses introduced in this chapter, such as まま and うちに, may actually be used as sentential and clausal conjunctions.
/// In this case, the demonstrative その must precede them.
/// The following pairs of examples illustrate the sentential and clausal uses of these conjunctions.

とても疲れて、６時頃、ソファに横になった。でも、そのまま、朝まで寝てしまった。//I lay down on the sofa at around 6:00 because I was so tired. But I ended up sleeping until morning.
とても疲れて、６時頃、ソファに横になったら、そのまま、朝まで寝てしまった。//I lay down on the sofa at around 6:00 because I was so tired, and ended up sleeping until morning.

テレビを見ていた。そしたら、そのうちに、寝てしまった。//I was watching TV. As I sat there watching, I fell asleep.
テレビを見ていたら、そのうちに、寝てしまった。//I was watching TV, and fell asleep as I sat there.

私は電話で話していた。その間に、ルームメートは晩ご飯を食べてしまった。//I was talking on the phone. While I was still talking, my roommate finished her dinner.
私は電話で話していたら、その間に、ルームメートは晩ご飯を食べてしまった。//During the time I was talking on the phone, my roommate finished her dinner.

/// 3: Similar Adverbial Phrases
/// There are a number of adverbs and adverbial phrases that are quite close in meaning.
/// Knowing the nuances and implications of each of these is very important for successful communication.
/// Some of these adverbs have been already introduced and used, but the following overview presents them all in the same place.

/// (1) せいで and おかげで
/// To attribute the cause of something to another person or thing, せいで or おかげで can be used.
/// The difference between the two is that せいで refers to a negative cause and おかげで to a positive one.

あなたのせいで、私は試験に失敗しました。//Because of you, I failed the examination.
/// [i.e., it’s the addressee’s fault]

あなたのおかげで、私は試験に通りました。//Thanks to you, I passed the examination.

/// The expression おかげさまで,a more polite phrasing ofおかげで, was introduced in the Preparatory Stage, as in the following:

おかげさまで、元気です。//Thanks to you, I’m well.

/// # せい or おかげ in predicates
/// せい and おかげ may also be used in the nominal predicate.

あなたが試験に失敗したのは、私のせいです。//It’s my fault that you failed the examination.
私が試験に通ったのは、あなたのおかげです。//Thanks to your help, I passed the test.

/// (2) ほとんど and めったに
/// Some adverbs, such as あまり, そんなに, and 全然（ぜんぜん）, require the predicate to be in the negative form.
/// There are a few more in this category, including ほとんど and めったに, which will be introduced in this section.

/// ほとんど, which refers to frequency, means “almost never.”

私は家にほとんど電話しません。//I hardly ever call home.

/// The adverb めったに indicates a little more frequency than ほとんど, but it is still not often.

うちの子供はめったに田中さんのお子さんと遊びません。//My child rarely plays with Tanaka-san’s child.

/// The adverbs 全然（ぜんぜん）, ほとんど, and めったに differ in degree of frequency.
/// The frequency increases from not at all to more frequent, in the following order:
/// 全然 → ほとんど → めったに

/// (3) わざわざ and せっかく
/// In many Japanese–English dictionaries, わざわざ and せっかく are defined similarly as “deliberately; with much trouble.”
/// Adverbs are in general very difficult to translate into another language, because the implications of a given adverb tend to be quite different in each language.
/// As ever, understanding the underlying meaning of each word is more important than learning it via translation alone.

/// # わざわざ
/// This adverb implies that the topic is doing something even though it is not necessary, and that this task may be a lot of trouble to complete.
/// わざわざ may be used in either a dependent or independent clause.

わざわざ料理したけれども、だれも食べてくれなかった。//I went to the trouble of cooking, but no one ate it.
このパーティーにはわざわざ着物を着なくてもいいですよ。//You needn’t take the trouble to wear a kimono to this party.

/// Because of its meaning, わざわざ is often used to thank someone for what he or she did.
/// The grateful person wants the addressee to know that it wasn’t necessary to do what was done.

遠くからわざわざ来てくださって、ありがとうございます。//Thank you for coming here from so far away.

/// # せっかく
/// This adverb indicates that the speaker is taking advantage of his or her current situation to do additional things.
/// The situation described in the dependent clause, in which せっかく is used, provides the opportunity for the action in the independent clause.
/// Because of this structure, せっかく cannot be used in simple sentences.

せっかくここまで来たのだから、海にも行きましょう。//Since we came all the way here, let’s take advantage of it and go to the beach.
せっかく日本に来たのに、田中さんに会えませんでした。//I came all the way to Japan, but I was unable to see Tanaka-san.
/// Literally, “it was too bad that I couldn’t take advantage of being in Japan to see Tanaka-san”

/// せっかく may be used to politely decline an offer or invitation by implying that the speaker regrets not being able to take the opportunity.
/// ですが in せっかくですが in this response implies that a more complete structure is abbreviated.
/// This expression has become a fixed expression for declining an offer politely.

明日、うちにいらっしゃいませんか。//Would you like to come visit me tomorrow?
せっかくですが、明日は行けません。//Thank you for the opportunity, but unfortunately I can’t take advantage of your invitation and visit you tomorrow.

/// In some cases, わざわざ and せっかく seem to be interchangeable, but there is a difference in nuance originating from the meanings described above.
/// The use of わざわざ modifies the action in the dependent clause, while the use of せっかく gives the reason for the action expressed in the main clause.

わざわざここまで来たのだから、海にも行きましょう。//Since we took the trouble to come here, let’s go to the beach as well.
せっかくここまで来たのだから、海にも行きましょう。//Since we came all the way here, let’s take advantage of it and go to the beach.

/// (4) やっと and とうとう
/// The adverbs やっと and とうとう, which were introduced in Stages 2–6, may both be translated as “finally” in a dictionary.
/// However, the notions presupposed by these adverbs are quite different.

/// やっと is used when the speaker’s expectation is reached after a long wait or prolonged effort.
/// In the first sentence below, it sounds as if the speaker has been waiting for rain for quite some time, and this wish has now been fulfilled.
/// In the second sentence, the implication is that the speaker had been making an effort to understand something, and the goal was finally met.

やっと雨が降ってきました。//The rain that I was hoping for has finally begun.
やっと分かりました。//I finally understood.

/// とうとう literally means that something has reached its end.
/// This adverb is often, but not always, used when something that the speaker has been afraid might happen actually does happen.
/// This fear does not have to be very strong, however.

とうとう雨が降ってきました。//It’s starting to rain; I was afraid it would.
とうとうぼくの犬は死んでしまいました。//I was dreading my dog’s death, and it finally happened.

/// In both cases, the speaker was fearfully anticipating the event in the sentence.
/// In both sentences, the event occurred despite the speaker’s wish that it would not.

/// Because of the difference in nuance between やっと and とうとう, confusing them could lead to a terrible misunderstanding.
/// For instance, when a long-awaited visitor finally arrives, it is definitely more appropriate to use やっと than とうとう.

やっと、来たのね。//You’re finally here!

/// In contrast, when the speaker fears that eventually it will be his or her turn to face something negative, the use of とうとう is more appropriate than やっと.

とうとう私の番が来てしまいました。//My turn has come, as I knew it would.

/// (5) Adverb あまり with positive predicates
/// あまり was introduced earlier as an adverb that requires a negative predicate.

この本はあまり面白くありませんでした。//This book was not very interesting.

/// When this adverb is used with a positive predicate, it stresses that what is expressed in the predicate exceeds expectations.
/// This adverb, however, is used only in a dependent clause;
/// the main clause must express the consequence.

この本があまり面白かったから、昨日、全部、読んでしまいました。//This book was so interesting that I read the whole thing yesterday.

/// When あまり is used in this way, the particle に or にも may also accompany it.

この本があまりに（も）面白かったから、昨日、全部、読んでしまいました。//This book was so interesting that I read the whole thing yesterday.

/// (1) Things are too expensive in Japan!

日本は物があんまり高くて、びっくりしました。//I’m shocked to find how expensive things are here in Japan.
この頃、少しは安くなったという気がしますが、まだまだ高いですよね。//It seems like they’ve gotten a bit cheaper lately, but you’re right, things are still quite expensive.
でも、物の質はいいですよね。//The quality is quite good, though.
それはそうですね。//That’s true.

/// # 気がする {きがする}
/// This idiomatic verb expresses the speaker’s hunch.
/// The feeling is not based so much on evidence as it is on the speaker’s instinct.

/// # 物の質 {もののしつ}
/// 質 {しつ} means “quality.” The meaning of this phrase is therefore “the quality of things.”

/// # まだまだ
/// The repetition of まだ emphasizes that things are still quite expensive.

/// # それはそうですね
/// When the speaker agrees with a specific point, using それ to refer to it, this expression may be used.
/// It means something like “the point you raise is true.”

/// (2) I was able to graduate because of you

///おば：
これ、ほんの気持ちだけだけど、卒業のお祝いにと思って・・・。//It’s not much, but here is a gift for your graduation.
///私：
お祝いだなんて。卒業できたのは、おばさんのお陰なんだから・・・。//A gift? But if it weren’t for you, I couldn’t have graduated.
///おば：
そんなことないわよ。あなたが一生懸命、頑張ったからよ。これからも頑張ってちょうだいね。//That’s not true. You worked very hard to graduate. Keep working hard.
///私：
うん、頑張るわ。叔母さんの健康がちょっと気になるけど。//Yes, I will. I’m a bit worried about your health, though.
///おば：
心配しないで。この頃、私、ピンピンしてるんだから。//Don’t worry. I’m quite healthy these days.

/// # ほんの気持ちだけ
/// ほんの means “just a little bit”;
/// 気持ち {きもち} here refers to “the speaker’s thoughts.”
/// So, ほんの気持ちだけ is often used when a person giving a present wants to say that what he or she is about to give is not a big thing, but that it expresses his or her thoughts.

/// # 卒業のお祝いにと思って
/// This phrase means “I thought this might be a good gift to celebrate your graduation.”
/// お祝い {いわい} means “celebration,” but it is also used to mean “gift.”

/// # そんなことない
/// This phrase can be used to negate another person’s statement.
/// It means something like “It’s not like that,” or “That’s not true.”

/// # 頑張ってちょうだい {がんば ってちょうだい}
/// ちょうだい is a colloquial version of ください.
/// When combined with other verbs, this verb may be used only when speaking to someone younger or to someone with less authority.

/// # 気になる
/// When something is either annoying or worrisome to the speaker, he or she can express it with this idiomatic phrase:

彼の言ったことが気になる。//What he said was annoying.
母の健康が気になる。//I’m worried about my mother’s health.

/// # ピンピンする
/// This onomatopoeia describes someone in good health.
