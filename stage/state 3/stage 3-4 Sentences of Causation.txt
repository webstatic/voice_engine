stage ３，４。
/// Stage 3-4 Sentences of Causation

/// 1: Causative Sentences
/// As mentioned in Stage 1–9, causative sentences, which are characterized by the use of causative verbs, express a person’s causing another person to do something.
/// The situation varies: it could be that the topic forces someone to do something, allows someone to do something, lets someone do something, or has someone do something, depending on the context.
/// In all these situations in Japanese, the topic of the causative sentence is a person with greater authority than the person mentioned in the object position.
/// When the topic has less authority than the person in the object position, a causative sentence may not be used.
/// In this case, other constructions must be used, some of which will be introduced in this chapter.

/// (1) Causative verb formation
/// Group 1: Change る to させる
/// Group 2: Change the final {u} to {a} and add せる
/// Group 3: [する → させる], [くる → こさせる]

/// All derived causative verbs are Group 1 verbs.
/// The following examples show how they conjugate: たべさせる → たべさせて, かわせる → かわせて.

/// (2) Verbs with no causative forms
/// There are a few groups of verbs that lack causative forms.

/// - Verbs that express non-actions or non-events lack the corresponding causative verbs.
/// For instance, some semi-transitive verbs, such as ある “to have; to exist” and 要る {いる} “to need,” do not have causative forms.

/// - The intransitive counterpart in a transitive-intransitive verb pair lacks a causative form:
/// e.g. 開く {あく}  “(something) opens” and 閉まる {しまる} “(something) closes.”

/// - Honorific verbs also lack causative forms:
/// e.g. いらっしゃる “to be”; “to go”; “to come,” くださる “to give (me),” おっしゃる “to say.”

/// (3) Causative sentences
/// Causative sentences have several different meanings, as shown in the English translation of the example below.
/// In some cases, only the context can determine which meaning the sentence conveys.
/// But in all cases, the person in the topic position has more power than the person in the object place.
/// It is therefore inappropriate to use a causative sentence to express the idea of a person with less power making a person with more power do something.

先生は学生に日本語を話させます。//The teacher makes/allows/lets the student speak Japanese.

/// When expressing more than one causative action with the たり-form, the causative element may be either in the final verb する, or in a verb in the non-final position, but not in both.
/// For instance, to describe the things a teacher makes his students do in class, the following sentence uses causative elements in the non-final position.

先生は学生に漢字を書かせたり、日本語を話させたりします。//The teacher makes his students do things like write kanji and speak Japanese.

/// In the following sentence, the causative form is in the final verb する.

先生は学生に漢字を書いたり、日本語を話したりさせます。//The teacher makes his students do things like write kanji and speak Japanese.

/// (4) The use of に and を with directional verbs
/// Some linguists say that different causative meanings can be identified by the use of different particles.
/// For instance, compare the following two sentences:

中村さんは子供にイギリスに行かせます。//Nakamura-san will allow his child to go to England.

中村さんは子供をイギリスに行かせます。//Nakamura-san will make his child go to England.
/// Literally, “Nakamura-san will force his child to go to England.

/// It is commonly said and believed that the use of に conveys the meaning of allowing,
/// whereas the use of を in the second sentence above would imply that the child is going despite his or her wishes to the contrary.
/// It is true that the difference between these sentences can be interpreted that way, but the difference is not as distinct as some linguists believe it to be.
/// Both of these sentences actually more or less convey the meaning of “making someone go somewhere.”

/// First of all, if this difference exists, it is a very slight one, and is true only when the verb expresses direction;
/// it does not apply to most other verbs.
/// Furthermore, regardless of the particle choice, に or を, the original meaning of the causative sentence still holds for both sentences;
/// that is, a person with power is causing a person with less power to do something.
/// Most importantly, to convey the meaning of allowing a person to do something, a more appropriate Japanese sentence would contain a giving verb in the predicate, as shown below.

中村さんは子供にイギリスに行かせてやりました。//Nakamura-san allowed his child to go to England.

/// (5) The use of に and を with other verbs
/// In this section, the use of に and を with verbs other than the directional verbs will be examined.
/// See the following example with the verb 笑う {わらう}, which means “to laugh”:

あの人はいつも面白い話をして、人を笑わせます。//That person always tells funny stories, and makes people laugh.

/// In this case, the use of を indicates that the topic makes people laugh.
/// It would be unnatural to interpret the sentence as saying that the topic allows or forces another person to laugh, since the verb expresses an involuntary action.
/// For involuntary actions, を should be used for the person who is being made to do the action.
/// A similar example can be found in the following sentence, where the act of crying is an involuntary action.

あの人はいつも子供を泣かせます。//That person always makes children cry.

/// In some artificial cases, it is possible for someone to have someone else do things such as laugh or cry.
/// For instance, if a movie director wanted to have an actor laugh in a particular scene, the use of に rather than を would indicate that.

その時に、チャンさんに笑わせます。//At that time, I will make Chang-san laugh.

/// # General rule for に or を for the person in the object position
/// The basic meaning conveyed by a causative sentence, regardless of the predicate used, is that the person in the topic position makes the person in the object position do something.
/// The implication is that the person in the object position carries out an action as a result.
/// The person in the object position of a causative sentence may be marked either by に or を, but these particles are not interchangeable.

/// When the verb is a transitive verb, the person who is made to act must be marked by に.
/// を may not be used here, because the direct object of the verb is marked by を.

あのうちでは、親は子供に自分のご飯を料理させます。//At that house, the parents have the children prepare their own meals.

/// For intransitive verbs, the person in the object position may be marked by に or を.
/// When を is used, it implies that the action taken by this person is an involuntary action.
/// In the following sentence, being upset is not a controllable action.

あの人はいつも私を怒らせます。//That person always makes me upset.

/// The reason some linguists believe that the use of を gives a coercive meaning may be due to this involuntary meaning conveyed by を.
/// That is, the sentence conveys the meaning of “an act not carried out deliberately” by the person mentioned in the object position.

/// When に is used, it indicates that a person deliberately carries out the action indicated by the verb:

今日は、スミスさんに泳がせるつもりだ。//I am planning to have Smith-san swim today.

/// (6) て-causatives with ください
/// The て-form of a causative verb with ください indicates that the speaker is volunteering to do something.

この飲み物は私に買わせてください。//Please let me buy this drink.

/// The speaker can also use this structure to request that someone else (a third person) do something.
/// In this case, the speaker must be in an authoritative position over both the addressee and the person who is being made to do something.

掃除は妹にさせてください。でも、洗濯は兄にさせてください。//Have my younger sister do the cleaning. But have my brother do laundry.

/// 2: Other Causative Forms
/// (1) Short causative forms
/// There is another set of causative forms called short causative forms.
/// They are used frequently in conversation.
/// The short causative forms can be obtained by changing the causative suffix せる to す.

/// - Meaning
/// eat wait buy come do
/// - Base form
/// たべる まつ かう くる する
/// - Long causative form
/// たべさせる またせる かわせる こさせる させる
/// - Short causative form
/// たべさす またす かわす こさす さす

/// All short causative verbs are Group 2 verbs:
/// たべさす → たべさします → たべさして; かえらす → かえらします → かえらして; こさす → こさします → こさして.

/// Short causative forms are used more often in casual settings than long causative forms.
/// However, there are individual as well as regional differences in the use of long and short causative forms.
/// Compare the long and short causative verbs in the following sentences:


あの人はいつも私を待たせます。//That person always makes me wait.
/// [long causative]

あの人はいつも私を待たします。//That person always makes me wait.
/// [short causative]

/// (2) Causative-like verbs
/// Some verbs have inherent causative-like meanings.
/// For instance, 起こす {おこす} means “to wake someone up”; and 着せる {きせる} “to put an outfit on someone else.”
/// These verbs are used as shown below:

母は妹を毎朝、７時に起こします。//My mother wakes my sister up at 7:00 every morning.
寒い日には、私は赤ちゃんにセーターを着せます。//On cold days, I put a sweater on the baby.

/// These verbs resemble causative verbs in that the topic causes someone to do or undergo something (e.g. my sister wakes up; the baby wears an outfit).
/// There is, however, a basic difference between the sentences above and sentences with causative verbs:
/// sentences with causative verbs indicate that the topic causes someone to actively do something.
/// Neither of the sentences above indicates such a voluntary action by the object.

/// In fact, these verbs do have causative forms, as shown below.
/// In the example sentences, the person marked by に actively carries out an action at the topic’s behest.

母は兄に妹を毎朝、７時に起こさせます。//My mother makes my brother wake up my sister at 7:00 every morning.
私は上の子供に赤ちゃんにセーターを着せさせます。//I have my older child put a sweater on the baby.

/// 3: Other Constructions of Causation
/// The use of causative verbs is not the only way to indicate that someone causes someone else to do something.

/// (1) ~て欲（ほ）しい
/// Recall that the stem with ~たい is a structure expressing the speaker’s desire to do something.

私はもっと勉強したいです。//I want to study more.

/// This structure may not be used when the speaker wants other people do something.
/// For this purpose, the て-form of the verb and the adjective 欲しい {ほしい} is used.

/// # Positive
/// The following sentences demonstrate the use of the positive predicate:

私はあなたにもっと勉強して欲しいです。//I want you to study more.
あの会議では私は森さんに話して欲しいと思っています。//I want Mori-san to speak at that meeting.

/// Since 欲しい, an emotive adjective, is a part of this structure, this construction may be used only when the speaker is expressing his or her own wish or when the speaker is asking the addressee a question directly.
/// Like other emotive words, this structure may not be used to describe a third person’s wish unless another element is added in the predicate.
/// Many such elements may be added; they all convey different nuances. The following is one such example:

田中先生は学生にもっと勉強して欲しいようです。//It seems that Tanaka-sensei wants his students to study more.

/// # Negative
/// There are two ways to negate the ~て欲しい construction.

あの会議では私は森さんに話して欲しくないと思っています。//I don’t want Mori-san to speak at that meeting.
あの会議では私は森さんに話さないで欲しいと思っています。//I don’t want Mori-san to say anything at that meeting.

/// The difference in meaning between the two is subtle:
/// the first sentence is based on the possibility that Mori-san might say something,
/// but the second sentence does not necessarily assume it.

/// # Causative-て + 欲しい
/// Compare the following three sentences:

私に行かせてください。//Please let me go.
私に行かせて欲しいです。//I want you to let me go.
中村さんに行かせて欲しいです。//I want you to let Nakamura-san go.

/// The first sentence is a direct request, while the latter two express requests by using statement sentences.

/// (2) Causatives and ~てもらう（~ていただく）
/// As has been pointed out more than once, only a person with greater authority can be the topic of a causative sentence.
/// For instance, in a case where a mother makes her child do something, the use of a causative sentence is appropriate.

うちの子に先生に手紙を書かせました。//I made my child write a letter to her teacher.

/// The following explanation and example sentences deal with a different power dynamic than the one in the situation above.
/// Suppose the speaker needs to ask someone with an equal level of authority to do something on her or his behalf.
/// In this case, it would not be appropriate to use a causative.
/// Instead, the use of ~てもらう (or ~ていただく, depending on whom the speaker asks) is more appropriate.
/// The sentence implies that the topic asked the person in the object position to do something and received the favor as a result of asking.

私はルームメートに手紙を書いてもらいました。//I had my roommate write a letter for me.

/// The following sentence is an example of a speaker making a request to someone who is in a position of greater authority than the speaker.

先生にこれを説明していただきました。//I asked the teacher to explain this to me.

/// When the speaker wants to volunteer something but needs to ask someone else,
/// then a combination of a causative verb and the verb もらう or いただく is necessary.

翻訳は私にさせてもらいました。//I requested that I be allowed to do the translation.

/// The difference between ~てもらう（いただく） and ~てくれる（くださる） may be reviewed in Stage 2–4.

/// 4: Causative-Passive Verbs and Sentences
/// (1) Causative-passive verb forms
/// Causative verbs may be changed into passive forms.
/// Since all causative verbs are Group 1 verbs, there is only one rule.
/// [る of causative verbs → られる]

/// The reverse does not work; that is, passive verbs cannot be changed into causative verbs.

/// - Base form
/// たべる いく かう する くる
/// - Causative form
/// たべさせる いかせる かわせる させる こさせる
/// - Causative-passive form
/// たべさせられる いかせられる かわせられる させられる こさせられる

子供の時、私は両親にミルクをたくさん飲ませられました。//When I was a child, I was made to drink a lot of milk by my parents.
日本語の授業では、いつも宿題をたくさんさせられます。//We are always made to do a lot of homework for our Japanese class.

/// (2) Short causative-passive verb forms
/// Just as causatives have the short causative form, there is also a corresponding passive form called the short causative-passive form.

/// As mentioned earlier, all short causatives are Group 2 verbs that end with す.
/// The rule for changing this into the passive is therefore as follows:
/// [Change the final vowel u to a and add れる]

/// Examples of short causative-passives
/// - Base form
/// いく まつ かう
/// - Long causative
/// いかせる またせる かわせる
/// - Short causative
/// いかす またす かわす
/// - Short causative-passive
/// いかされる またされる かわされる

彼と待ち合わせをする時は、いつも待たされます。//I am always made to wait for him when I meet with him.
あの店に行くと、いつも要らない物をたくさん買わされます。//Whenever I go to that store, I am always made to buy many unnecessary things.

/// # Awkward short causative-passive forms
/// The short causative-passives are used most often with the original (i.e. not derived) Group 2 verbs.
/// The original Group 1 and 3 verbs result in the syllable repetition of ささ, which makes the forms awkward.
/// The only verbs among the original Group 2 verbs that produce such an awkward form are those that end with ~す, like 話す.
/// The following illustrates some awkward short causative-passive forms.
/// They are awkward, but some may be used colloquially.

/// - Base form
/// たべる する くる はなす
/// - Long causative
/// たべさせる させる こさせる はなさせる
/// - Short causative
/// たべさす さす こさす はなさす
/// - Short causative-passive
/// たべさされる さされる こさされる はなさされる
