/// Stage 3-4 Sentences of Causation

/// 1: Causative Sentences
/// As mentioned in Stage 1–9, causative sentences, which are characterized by the use of causative verbs, express a person’s causing another person to do something.
/// The situation varies: it could be that the topic forces someone to do something, allows someone to do something, lets someone do something, or has someone do something, depending on the context.
/// In all these situations in Japanese, the topic of the causative sentence is a person with greater authority than the person mentioned in the object position.
/// When the topic has less authority than the person in the object position, a causative sentence may not be used.
/// In this case, other constructions must be used, some of which will be introduced in this chapter.

/// (1) Causative verb formation
/// Group 1: Change る to させる
/// Group 2: Change the final {u} to {a} and add せる
/// Group 3: [する → させる], [くる → こさせる]

/// All derived causative verbs are Group 1 verbs.
/// The following examples show how they conjugate: たべさせる → たべさせて, かわせる → かわせて.

/// (2) Verbs with no causative forms
/// There are a few groups of verbs that lack causative forms.

/// - Verbs that express non-actions or non-events lack the corresponding causative verbs.
/// For instance, some semi-transitive verbs, such as ある “to have; to exist” and 要る {いる} “to need,” do not have causative forms.

/// - The intransitive counterpart in a transitive-intransitive verb pair lacks a causative form:
/// e.g. 開く {あく}  “(something) opens” and 閉まる {しまる} “(something) closes.”

/// - Honorific verbs also lack causative forms:
/// e.g. いらっしゃる “to be”; “to go”; “to come,” くださる “to give (me),” おっしゃる “to say.”

/// (3) Causative sentences
/// Causative sentences have several different meanings, as shown in the English translation of the example below.
/// In some cases, only the context can determine which meaning the sentence conveys.
/// But in all cases, the person in the topic position has more power than the person in the object place.
/// It is therefore inappropriate to use a causative sentence to express the idea of a person with less power making a person with more power do something.

先生は学生に日本語を話させます。//The teacher makes/allows/lets the student speak Japanese.

/// When expressing more than one causative action with the たり-form, the causative element may be either in the final verb する, or in a verb in the non-final position, but not in both.
/// For instance, to describe the things a teacher makes his students do in class, the following sentence uses causative elements in the non-final position.

先生は学生に漢字を書かせたり、日本語を話させたりします。//The teacher makes his students do things like write kanji and speak Japanese.

/// In the following sentence, the causative form is in the final verb する.

先生は学生に漢字を書いたり、日本語を話したりさせます。//The teacher makes his students do things like write kanji and speak Japanese.

/// (4) The use of に and を with directional verbs
/// Some linguists say that different causative meanings can be identified by the use of different particles.
/// For instance, compare the following two sentences:

中村さんは子供にイギリスに行かせます。//Nakamura-san will allow his child to go to England.

中村さんは子供をイギリスに行かせます。//Nakamura-san will make his child go to England.
/// Literally, “Nakamura-san will force his child to go to England.

/// It is commonly said and believed that the use of に conveys the meaning of allowing,
/// whereas the use of を in the second sentence above would imply that the child is going despite his or her wishes to the contrary.
/// It is true that the difference between these sentences can be interpreted that way, but the difference is not as distinct as some linguists believe it to be.
/// Both of these sentences actually more or less convey the meaning of “making someone go somewhere.”

/// First of all, if this difference exists, it is a very slight one, and is true only when the verb expresses direction;
/// it does not apply to most other verbs.
/// Furthermore, regardless of the particle choice, に or を, the original meaning of the causative sentence still holds for both sentences;
/// that is, a person with power is causing a person with less power to do something.
/// Most importantly, to convey the meaning of allowing a person to do something, a more appropriate Japanese sentence would contain a giving verb in the predicate, as shown below.

中村さんは子供にイギリスに行かせてやりました。//Nakamura-san allowed his child to go to England.

/// (5) The use of に and を with other verbs
/// In this section, the use of に and を with verbs other than the directional verbs will be examined.
/// See the following example with the verb 笑う {わらう}, which means “to laugh”:

あの人はいつも面白い話をして、人を笑わせます。//That person always tells funny stories, and makes people laugh.

/// In this case, the use of を indicates that the topic makes people laugh.
/// It would be unnatural to interpret the sentence as saying that the topic allows or forces another person to laugh, since the verb expresses an involuntary action.
/// For involuntary actions, を should be used for the person who is being made to do the action.
/// A similar example can be found in the following sentence, where the act of crying is an involuntary action.

あの人はいつも子供を泣かせます。//That person always makes children cry.

/// In some artificial cases, it is possible for someone to have someone else do things such as laugh or cry.
/// For instance, if a movie director wanted to have an actor laugh in a particular scene, the use of に rather than を would indicate that.

その時に、チャンさんに笑わせます。//At that time, I will make Chang-san laugh.

/// # General rule for に or を for the person in the object position
/// The basic meaning conveyed by a causative sentence, regardless of the predicate used, is that the person in the topic position makes the person in the object position do something.
/// The implication is that the person in the object position carries out an action as a result.
/// The person in the object position of a causative sentence may be marked either by に or を, but these particles are not interchangeable.

/// When the verb is a transitive verb, the person who is made to act must be marked by に.
/// を may not be used here, because the direct object of the verb is marked by を.

あのうちでは、親は子供に自分のご飯を料理させます。//At that house, the parents have the children prepare their own meals.

/// For intransitive verbs, the person in the object position may be marked by に or を.
/// When を is used, it implies that the action taken by this person is an involuntary action.
/// In the following sentence, being upset is not a controllable action.

あの人はいつも私を怒らせます。//That person always makes me upset.

/// The reason some linguists believe that the use of を gives a coercive meaning may be due to this involuntary meaning conveyed by を.
/// That is, the sentence conveys the meaning of “an act not carried out deliberately” by the person mentioned in the object position.

/// When に is used, it indicates that a person deliberately carries out the action indicated by the verb:

今日は、スミスさんに泳がせるつもりだ。//I am planning to have Smith-san swim today.

/// (6) て-causatives with ください
/// The て-form of a causative verb with ください indicates that the speaker is volunteering to do something.

この飲み物は私に買わせてください。//Please let me buy this drink.

/// The speaker can also use this structure to request that someone else (a third person) do something.
/// In this case, the speaker must be in an authoritative position over both the addressee and the person who is being made to do something.

掃除は妹にさせてください。でも、洗濯は兄にさせてください。//Have my younger sister do the cleaning. But have my brother do laundry.

/// 2: Other Causative Forms
/// (1) Short causative forms
/// There is another set of causative forms called short causative forms.
/// They are used frequently in conversation.
/// The short causative forms can be obtained by changing the causative suffix せる to す.

/// - Meaning
/// eat wait buy come do
/// - Base form
/// たべる まつ かう くる する
/// - Long causative form
/// たべさせる またせる かわせる こさせる させる
/// - Short causative form
/// たべさす またす かわす こさす さす

/// All short causative verbs are Group 2 verbs:
/// たべさす → たべさします → たべさして; かえらす → かえらします → かえらして; こさす → こさします → こさして.

/// Short causative forms are used more often in casual settings than long causative forms.
/// However, there are individual as well as regional differences in the use of long and short causative forms.
/// Compare the long and short causative verbs in the following sentences:


あの人はいつも私を待たせます。//That person always makes me wait.
/// [long causative]

あの人はいつも私を待たします。//That person always makes me wait.
/// [short causative]
