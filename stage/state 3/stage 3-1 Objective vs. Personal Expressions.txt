/// Stage 3-1 Objective vs. Personal Expressions

/// 1: こと and の
/// (1) Review of こと and の
/// The following is a summary of points that have already been introduced.
/// One new piece of information is added at the end of this section, namely the use of こと and の in the predicate position.
/// After this review section, additional information on こと and の will be introduced.

/// # こと as a noun and の as a pronoun
/// The following examples show that こと is a noun, while の is a pronoun:

昨日、山田さんに面白いことを聞きました。//I heard an interesting thing from Yamada-san yesterday.
さっきまであなたのことについて話していました。//We were talking about you until a little while ago.
私が読んだ本はこの本です。あなたが読んだのはどれですか。//This book is the one that I read. Which one did you read?

/// # こと and の as nominalizers
/// Both こと and の function grammatically as nominalizers, and they often can be used interchangeably in such positions as the topic and the object.

毎日、歩くことは体にとてもいいです。//Walking every day is very good for your health.
/// or 毎日、歩くのは体にとてもいいです。

僕は人の前で話すことが嫌いです。//I don’t like to speak in front of other people.
/// or 僕は人の前で話すのが嫌いです。

/// # Non-interchangeable こと and の in fixed phrases
/// In many fixed phrases such as with ある and できる, こと and の are not interchangeable.
/// In the following cases, only こと may be used.

先生を家に招待したことはありませんが、先輩を招待したことが一度、あります。//I have never invited a teacher to my home, but I once invited a senior student.
私は漢字が二千も読むことができます。//I can read as many as two thousand kanji.

/// # Non-interchangeable こと and の in predicates
/// Although the fact has not been introduced up to this point, こと and の are not interchangeable when used as nominalizers in the predicate.
/// In this case, only こと may be used.

私の趣味は本を読むことです。//My hobby is reading books.

/// (2) The referent of の
/// In some cases, the referent of the pronoun の is not given anywhere in the sentence or discourse.
/// The referent of の, however, is quite apparent from the meaning of a sentence.
/// In the first example, の refers to a place, and in the second, の refers to a person.

私が生まれたのは東京です。//Tokyo is where I was born.
私が話したのは山田さんです。//The one I spoke to was Yamada-san.

/// (3) こと and の with perception verbs
/// There is a significant difference between こと and の when they are used with verbs of perception.

私は中田さんがピアノをひいているのを聞きました。//I heard Nakada-san playing the piano.
私は中田さんがピアノをひいていることを聞きました。//I heard that Nakada-san is (or has been) playing the piano (somewhere).

/// The two sentences are identical except for the use of こと and の.
/// Yet the meaning of each is quite different.
/// In the first sentence, the speaker directly perceived Nakada-san playing the piano in person, so only の is acceptable here.

/// In the second sentence, in which こと is used, what the speaker heard was the information or report that Nakada-san is (or has been) playing the piano.
/// The speaker did not get a direct perception of Nakada-san’s playing by hearing it in person at all;
/// what she or he heard was the fact that Nakadasan is (or has been) playing the piano. Here only こと may be used.

上田さんが歩いているのを見ました。//I saw Ueda-san walking.

/// In this case, こと is unacceptable because the speaker is the one who saw Ueda-san walking. It is not possible to see the information.

/// In sum, when the main verbs are perceptual verbs such as 聞く {きく} and 見る, こと and の are not interchangeable.
/// こと gives an indirect objective interpretation of an event while の gives a personal and direct one.

/// When こと and の are interchangeable, as in some of the earlier sentences above, there is a nuance difference, objective vs. personal, between the two sentences.

/// (4) の in complex predicates
/// の（ん in conversation） is used in the predicate to indicate that the statement made in the sentence is the speaker’s explanation.
/// の in the following two examples is the same の as in のだ.

/// # のだろう
/// As explained earlier, だろう, instead of だ, is used when the speaker is not 100% certain that the statement is true.

この授業はそんなに難しくないでしょう。//This class is probably not that difficult.

/// When の intervenes between the first predicate and だろう, it indicates that the speaker is giving his or her own interpretation based on first-hand observation.
/// Recall that な must stand between the nominal predicate and の.

あの女の人は先生なのだろう。//From what I have seen, I think that woman is probably a teacher.

/// Recall that the speaker is not able to express a third person’s emotion in the predicate directly.
/// When の is used in the predicate, it indicates that the statement is based on the speaker’s observation.
/// Since the use of だろう makes it less certain, the combination is quite appropriate to express a third person’s feelings.

あの人は犬がこわいのでしょう。//From my observations, it seems like that guy is afraid of dogs.

/// The following is an example of a verbal predicate.
/// The context of the following statement might be that the speaker has been wondering how Suzuki-san will reach his destination.
/// The speaker might make the following statement based on his or her own observations:

鈴木さんは自転車で行くのでしょう。//I gather that Suzuki-san will probably go by bicycle.

/// # のかもしれない
/// かもしれない used at the end of a predicate conveys a meaning that is very similar to the structure with だろう discussed above. However, だろう conveys more certainty than かもしれない.

/// As is the case with だろう, the use of の before かもしれない indicates that the statement is made based on the speaker’s direct observation, and therefore expresses his or her own interpretation of the situation.
/// もしかすると means something like “by chance; there is a chance.” It is used often with かもし れない.

もしかすると、友達は来週、来るのかもしれません。//Based on my observation, I think there is a chance my friend will come next week.
もしかすると、あの人はこれが見えないのかもしれません。//Based on my observations, I think it’s possible that he is unable to see this.

/// 2: Adverbial Clauses with ので and のに
/// (1) Adverbial clauses with ので
/// ので comes from the complex predicate のだ. The で in ので is the conjunctive form of the copula だ.
/// As previously explained, のだ is used in statements to convey the speaker’s personal explanation.

/// To answer a why-question, it is quite possible to simply respond by using the complex predicate のだ.

どうして、昨日、授業を休んだのですか。//So, why didn’t you come to class yesterday?
ちょっとお腹が痛かったんです。//Because I had a stomachache.

/// Although ので is related to のだ, as explained above, it functions as a clausal conjunction to connect the cause-adverbial to its consequence.

お腹が痛かったので、昨日、授業を休みました。//I didn’t go to class yesterday because I had a stomachache.

/// So far, three structures that indicate a cause-consequence relation have been introduced. Some differences among the three are discussed below.

/// (2) Differences between から and ので
/// # Structural differences between から and ので
/// The only structural difference between から and ので arises when the first clause is a nominal predicate. The plain copula だ must be used before から, while な must be used before ので:

あの人は日本人だから、日本語を話します。//She speaks Japanese because she is Japanese.
あの人は日本人なので、日本語を話します。//She speaks Japanese because she is Japanese.

/// # Differences in meaning between から and ので
/// ので and から are interchangeable most of the time, especially when the main clause states a factual event.
/// The general difference is that causes expressed with から provide objective reasons, while those with ので offer personal ones.
/// Therefore, even when either one is acceptable, this difference in nuance exists.

これはあまりおいしくないので、食べませんでした。//This didn’t taste very good, so I didn’t eat it.
これはあまりおいしくないから、食べませんでした。//This didn’t taste very good, so I didn’t eat it.

/// # Cases in which ので should not be used
/// When the main clause expresses such things as requests, commands, suggestions, or invitations, the use of ので can be awkward.
/// Such clauses are better joined by から, which is used in more objective cause-consequence sequences.

これはあまりおいしくないから、食べないで下さい。//Please don’t eat this, because it doesn’t taste good.

/// Another situation in which the use of ので is inappropriate is when the copula is used as an abbreviated predicate.

この大学の学生はなぜ日本語を勉強しませんか。//Why don’t students at this college study Japanese?
日本語の先生がいないからです。//Because they don’t have a Japanese teacher.

/// ので may not be used in such an abbreviated way.
/// Because the で of ので is the conjunctive form of the copula, another copula may not be used consecutively.

/// Instead, のです may be used as a complex predicate.

日本語の先生がいないの（ん）です。//Because there isn’t a Japanese teacher there.

/// # The politeness factor
/// In general, sentences in which ので is used are more polite than those with から.
/// This is because の で implies a sense of a personal accountability for the cause-consequence relation;
/// that is, the speaker takes responsibility for the cause of the consequence.

/// # The cause with ~て
/// When the causal adverbial clause with ~て is used, the consequence expressed in the main clause must be a naturally occurring result, such as emotion or ability.
/// It may not be an intentional act.

これはおいしくなくて、食べられませんでした。//This didn’t taste very good, so I couldn’t eat it.

/// (3) Adverbial clauses with のに
/// The meaning of the adverbial clause with のに is “despite the fact (given in the dependent clause).”
/// The の of this のに is the same の previously discussed in this chapter; that is, the personal interpretation.
/// The function of のに is quite similar to けれども in the sense that they are both used in adverbial clauses.
/// The similar conjunctions が and でも are not used in complex sentences.

/// The basic difference between のに and けれども is that のに may not be used when the main clause does not state a factual event.

/// The の in のに may not be reduced to ん, even for casual speech. (The の in ので, however, may be shortened to ん).

あの子供はもう随分大きいのに、まだ話せません。//Although that child seems rather big to me, he still can’t talk.
あの人は日本人なのに、着物をぜんぜん着ません。//Although I know that that person is Japanese, she never wears a kimono.

/// As the following incorrect example demonstrates, のに may not be used when the main clause is a command, request, or suggestion.

/// In this case, the two clauses may be joined by けれども. See the following:

寒いけれども、ここに来て下さいませんか。//Even though it’s cold, could you please come over here?

/// When the main clause expresses an outcome that has already taken place, the sentence is quite acceptable.

寒いのに、泳ぎに行きました。//Even though it was cold, we went swimming.

/// When the adverbial clause expresses a condition that is or was inconvenient to others, and the main clause indicates that a task was completed despite this adverse condition, it is better to use のに than the objective けれども.
/// のに indicates that the speaker is aware of the adverse condition.

北村さんは気分がよくないのに、私を手伝ってくれました。//I knew that Kitamura-san wasn’t feeling well, but she helped me anyway.

/// When thanking someone for doing something in spite of adverse conditions, this difference should be easy to understand.

お忙しいのに、来てくださって、本当にありがとうございました。//I know how busy you are, and I do appreciate your coming here despite that.

/// 3: Situation-Focus vs. Person-Focus
/// (1) Revisiting verbs する and なる
/// Situation-focused vs. person-focused expressions were introduced with using the verbs する and なる.
/// For instance, announcing a dinner selection may be done in two different ways: する is person-focused, while なる is situation-focused.

晩ご飯は和食にしました。//We’ve decided to serve Japanese food for dinner.
晩ご飯は和食になりました。//It was decided that the dinner would be Japanese food.

/// (2) ことにする vs. ことになる
/// Earlier in this chapter, it was pointed out that in certain fixed expressions, the nominalizers こと and の are not interchangeable.
/// Nominalizing verbs preceding ~にする and ~になる represent one such case.
/// When a verb is used before する or なる, the nominalizer こと, rather than の, must precede the verb.

/// # When to use which?
/// The implications of person-focused and situation-focused sentences are quite different.
/// In many cases, する is used to report a personal decision made in a certain situation.
/// In such a case, the addressee is probably aware of the options that the speaker had prior to making the decision reported.

明日、両親に電話することにしました。//I decided that I would call my parents tomorrow.

/// When なる is used, the speaker is reporting the objective outcome, rather than what the speaker has decided to do in a certain situation.
/// When such a construction as the one below is used, the matter sounds quite significant, because the implication is that it took much thought to arrive at the decision.

明日、両親に電話することになりました。//It’s been decided that I will call my parents tomorrow.

/// In some situations, the decision is not solely within the speaker’s control.
/// For instance, a situation such as graduating from school depends on many factors; it is not just a personal decision.
/// If the following statement were made, it would imply that the speaker has earned enough credits to graduate and that he or she has the option of when to graduate (not a common situation).

この六月に卒業することにしました。//I decided to graduate this June.

/// When publicly announcing a graduation (such as in an invitation card for a graduation party), the following expression with なる is much more appropriate. Even though the speaker has not graduated yet, the main verb must be in the perfective aspect. The perfective aspect here indicates that the decision has already been made about the coming commencement.

この六月に卒業することになりました。//I will be graduating this June.

/// # Culturally speaking
/// Though it is largely situational, it is generally more appropriate to use なる when making a public announcement (e.g. wedding, graduation, starting school, starting a new job, etc.).
/// For personal matters, day-to-day decisions are more likely to be expressed with する (food, shopping, assignment, etc.).
/// When なる is used for daily decisions, it indicates that the decision is not a trivial one.

/// (3) Revisiting transitive-intransitive verb pairs
/// As explained in earlier chapters, a few hundred transitive-intransitive pairs of verbs exist in Japanese.
/// In general, the transitive verbs of these pairs are used for person-focused expressions, while intransitives are situation-focused.

/// Depending on the situation, it may be more appropriate to use a transitive verb in some cases.
/// In other cases, the reverse is true.
/// The main point is that “who” did something can be expressed only via the use of transitive verbs.

/// If the speaker broke an important item—say, a cell phone–that his or her roommate treasured, how would he or she apologize for the mistake?
/// Using an intransitive verb would imply that the cell phone broke for an unfortunate reason (e.g. wind blew it off the table; a cat walked near it and knocked it off the table).
/// But when a transitive verb is used, it makes it obvious that the speaker did something like dropping it by mistake.
/// Therefore, the first example below would be more appropriate than the second.  ( 壊す {こわす} is transitive, while 壊れる {こわれる} is intransitive).

大切な携帯を壊してしまって、本当にごめんなさい。//I am so sorry I broke your precious cell phone.

/// In trying to comfort the person who is feeling bad about breaking the phone, one might make the following statement, using an intransitive verb:

携帯はよく壊れるから、私は何とも思っていませんよ。心配しないでください。//Cell phones break all the time, so I don’t think anything of it. Please don’t worry about it.

/// Imagine how the following inappropriate sentence using a transitive verb might sound to the addressee:

/// (4) Transitive て-forms with ある (situation-focused)
/// The use of transitive verbs is by nature person-focused, because the verb implies that the topic operates on the object.
/// Transitive verbs can, however, be used for situation-focused expressions as well, with the following construction:

戸が開けてあります。//The door has been opened.

/// The construction above contains the conjunctive form of a transitive verb and ある.
/// Not all transitive verbs may be used in the above construction; it is limited to those transitive verbs that leave some kind of trace of the result of completing the action implied by the verb.
/// In the above sentence, someone opened the door (transitive act; person-focused) and the door is left standing open (situation-focused).
/// Even though the sentence implies that someone opened the door, it is not possible to articulate the person in this kind of construction.

/// Compare the following.
/// Although the verbs 書く and 飲む are both transitive, the てある-construction is acceptable with 書く, but not with 飲む.
/// This is because a name can be traced after someone has written it, but water cannot be traced after it is consumed.

ここに名前が書いてあります。//The name is written here.

/// 4: なら-Adverbial as a Situational Condition
/// A number of conditional adverbial clauses have been introduced so far (e.g., clauses joined by とき, と, ~たら, ~ば);
/// each of these gives a distinct meaning to the preceding clause and connects it to the main clause.
/// It would be wise to review these clauses at this point to ensure that everything introduced has been clearly understood.

/// The most salient meaning of the なら-adverbial, as distinct from all the other conditionals, is that the condition expressed in the なら-clause is how the speaker interprets a situation in the context of the speaker’s earlier deeds or statements (whether verbalized or assumed).
/// The speaker’s interpretation is offered as a possible condition for the consequence expressed in the main clause.

/// What this means is that the なら-conditional clause has a certain reference point (i.e., the previous statement, thought, etc.).
/// This is not true for other conditional clauses.

/// The なら-conditional clause is similar in nuance to the たら-conditional clause with the complex predicate with のだ.

あなたが行くのだったら、私は行きません。//If I understand that you are going to go, I will not go.
あなたが行くなら、私は行きません。//If it seems to me that you are going to go, I will not go.

/// の may be inserted between the clause and なら, emphasizing the speaker’s interpretation of the situation:

あなたが行くのなら、私は行きません。//I take it that you may go, and if that is in fact the case, I will not go.
あの授業がそんなに難しいのなら、辞めたらどうですか。//If the class is that difficult, why don’t you quit?

/// It is not incorrect to insert の with the nominal predicate, as seen below.
/// However, this is a rather awkward structure because there are too many clusters of elements that indicate the speaker’s personal interpretation.
/// Without の, the personal account is well expressed:

あの人が日本人なら、この仕事をあの人に頼みましょうか。//If that person is indeed Japanese, shall we ask her to do this job?


ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
カンバセーション。

/// (1) He got upset again!

山田君、どこ？//Where is Yamada-kun?
ええ？山田君なら、もう帰っちゃいましたよ。//What? If you’re asking about Yamada-kun, he already went home.
ええ？もう、帰った？//He went home already?
ええ。また、怒ったんでしょ、きっと。//Yeah. I’m sure he got upset again!

/// # ええ？
/// With a rising tone, this vocalization indicates that the speaker is quite surprised.
/// Greater surprise is expressed with a more drawn-out pronunciation.

/// # A short でしょ
/// If she or he is upset, a speaker may cut でしょう rather short, following it immediately with the next word.
/// However, not every short でしょ indicates that the speaker is upset.

/// # Word order inversion
/// The last line shows an inversion of the predicate and an adverb, きっと “surely.”
/// This kind of inversion occurs in conversation.
/// The last word is added as an afterthought, or to show that the speaker wants to emphasize the word.

/// (2) A quick errand

ちょっと、お腹、すいたんで、出てきます。//I’m a little hungry, so I’m going to go out for a moment.
どこ、行くの？//Where are you going?
コンビニ、行ってきます。//Just to the mini-mart.
コンビニかあ。僕も行こうかな？//Mini mart . . . hmm . . . I think I’ll go, too.

/// # んで for causes
/// ので may be shortened to んで in conversation.

/// # コンビニかあ
/// The vowel in the question particle か may be prolonged while trying to come up with things to say.

/// (3) Declining an offer politely

もう少し、いかがですか。//How about a little more?
ありがとうございます。これで十分です。//Thank you, but I’ve had plenty.
そうですか・・・でも、少しだけなら、大丈夫でしょう？//Really? But you can have just a bit more, can’t you?
いいえ、本当にもう結構です。//No, really, I’m fine.

/// # これで十分です  {これでじゅうぶんです}
/// It is quite common for a Japanese host to offer things like food and drink repeatedly, even if the guest declines the offer.
/// This phrase, and もう結構です  {もうけっこうです} below, are typical ways to politely decline an offer.

/// 十分 {じゅうぶん} is an adjectival noun that means “sufficient; enough.”
/// これで十分です means “this is sufficient.”
/// で in this case indicates a boundary delimiting the amount that the speaker has.

/// # もう結構です
/// This is another polite way to decline an offer.
/// The adjectival noun 結構 {けっこう} means “great; fine; excellent.”
/// With もう, the phrase means something like, “I’m fine with the way things are right now.”
/// The phrase 結構です may be used either for praising something or declining an offer, depending on the situation.

/// (4) It’s my fault

どうしたんですか。何かあったんですか。//What’s wrong? Did something happen?
うん、ちょっと。日本語の試験の成績、本当にひどかったんです。//Yeah, kinda . . . I got an awful grade on my Japanese test.
試験、難しかったんじゃないですか。//Well, it was a hard test, wasn’t it?
そうじゃないんです。僕がいけないんです。勉強しなかったんです。//It wasn’t that. It’s my fault. I just didn’t study.

/// # Giving a vague answer うん、ちょっと
/// うん、ちょっと is a way to give a vague answer to a question, especially if the speaker is put into a situation where he or she needs to explain something personal.
