/// Stage 3-8 Overriding Particles

/// 1: The Overriding Particle こそ

/// (1) Overriding particles
/// Recall that there are three kinds of particles:
/// 1. linking particles, which connect two elements such as a noun and a predicate, or a noun and another noun (e.g., が, を, の);
/// 2. sentence-final particles, which are placed at the end of sentences to show what type of sentence it is (e.g., か, よ, ね);
/// 3. overriding particles, which add other meanings to the original particles (e.g., は, も, だけ).

/// This chapter will introduce additional overriding particles.

/// (2) こそ with a positive predicate
/// こそ indicates that, to the speaker, the preceding noun is the ultimate one in its category.
/// Here the term “highlighting” is used to indicate this function.

/// # こそ with a noun
/// If the speaker believes that an ideal teacher possesses a certain quality, and, consequently, that Tanaka-sensei has that exact quality,
/// Tanaka-sensei could be highlighted as in the following statement:

田中先生こそ私が理想としている先生です。//I consider Tanaka-sensei to be the ideal teacher.

/// A noun phrase marked by こそ has a meaning similar to one marked with が, which puts emphasis on the topic.
/// The difference between が and こそ is that が can be used only for the topic that is being emphasized, but こそ may be used in other parts of a sentence (e.g., the object position).
/// In the following sentence, 日本に留学すること is actually the object of 楽しみにする.
/// When こそ is used, it is usually placed at the beginning of a sentence.

日本に留学することこそ、私が一番、楽しみにしていたことだ。//What I’ve been looking forward to, above all, is studying abroad in Japan.

/// # こそ in the predicate
/// こそ may highlight an entire clause, rather than just a noun or noun phrase:

学生のことを思っているからこそ、たくさん勉強させているのです。//I’m making my students study a lot precisely because I care about them.
勉強は、努力してこそ、意味があるものなのです。//Studying has meaning only when you make an effort.

/// # Fixed expressions
/// The expression こちらこそ was introduced in the Preparatory Stage as a way to respond to an expression of thanks or an apology.
/// For instance, suppose that someone offered the following apology to the speaker:

本当にすみませんでした。//I’m really sorry.

/// The speaker could then respond by saying.

いいえ。こちらこそ。//No, I’m the one (who should apologize).

/// こそ is used here because the speaker believes that he or she, referred to as こちら, is, above all, the one who should apologize.

/// (3) こそ with a negative predicate
/// A noun modified by こそ in a sentence with a negative predicate is highlighted as an ultimate possible event or condition that did not take place.
/// In this case, the second clause normally indicates that the situation is not bad, despite the fact that the condition has not been realized.

/// The following example implies that ideally speaking, the book would be published,
/// but the negative predicate indicates that in reality it has not been,
/// but the quality of the book is superb despite this negative condition.

この本は出版こそされていないが、素晴らしい書物だと思う。//It hasn’t been published, but I think it’s a wonderful book.

/// The next example expresses that while having money is ideal, this is a condition that has not been met;
/// however, this negative situation has not had a serious effect on the speaker’s life.

お金こそないが、幸せな生活をしている。//I don’t have money, but my life is quite happy.

/// 2: The Overriding Particle さえ
/// When a noun is followed by the particle さえ, it indicates that it is the least likely thing, person, or event the speaker can imagine in a certain situation.

/// (1) さえ with a negative predicate
/// Because of the meaning that noun phrases with さえ convey, sentences with さえ are often in the negative.

/// Suppose the speaker cooked something that did not turn out well.
/// The speaker knows that the last person who would complain about such a thing is Mori-san.
/// In the following sentence, さえ expresses that even Mori-san, who would normally eat just about anything, did not eat the food the speaker cooked.

森さんさえ私の料理に手をつけなかった。//Even Mori-san didn’t touch the food I cooked.

/// # さえ with numbers
/// さえ is often used to indicate the least possible amount.
/// Suppose the speaker wants to express that she or he has no money, the following sentence may be used to express this situation.

一セントさえ持っていなかった。//I had no money, not even a cent.

/// The overriding particle も with a negative predicate conveys a similar meaning.

一セントも持っていなかった。//I didn’t have a cent.

/// In fact, さえ and も may be combined to emphasize the severity of the situation:

一セントさえも持っていなかった。//I didn’t have a single cent.

/// # も and さえ
/// Although sentences with も and さえ may convey similar meanings,
/// this does not mean that も and さえ have the same meaning and are thus interchangeable.
/// In fact, they differ slightly in nuance.
/// In the following examples, both も and さえ indicate that people other than Mori-san did not touch the food.
/// The sentence with さえ, however, implies that the speaker expected that at least Mori-san would eat the food,
/// but even this minimum requirement was not fulfilled.
/// Such an assumption is lacking with も. The use of も simply indicates that Mori-san was not an exception.

森さんさえ私の料理に手をつけなかった。//Even Mori-san didn’t touch the food I cooked.
森さんも私の料理に手をつけなかった。//Mori-san didn’t touch the food I cooked, either.

/// (2) さえ with a positive predicate
/// A noun phrase marked by さえ indicates that this is the least expected person or thing to do something.
/// Suppose the speaker is a comedian, and everyone laughed during his or her performance.

/// The sentence below indicates that Mori-san is the last person that anyone expected to laugh, and even he or she laughed at the performance.

森さんさえ笑ってくれた。//Even Mori-san laughed.

/// # さえ with a conditional predicate
/// When used in general statements containing a positive predicate, さえ often accompanies a conditional adverbial clause.

/// Suppose that the speaker’s minimum requirement for a meal is that there be rice.

ご飯さえあれば、食事は何でもいい。//As long as there’s rice, anything will make a meal.
ご飯さえあったら、食事は何でもいい。//As long as there’s rice, anything will make a meal.

/// If the speaker believes that practicing every day is what is minimally necessary to be good at Japanese, then she or he can say the following:

毎日、練習さえしていれば、日本語は上手になる。//If you at least practice every day, you’ll get good at Japanese.

/// # すら
/// すら is a particle that is very similar to さえ in usage, especially in negative sentences.
/// すら is used more in formal writing and speech, whereas さえ is used for both colloquial and formal writing and speech.

一セントすら持っていなかった。//I didn’t have a single cent.

/// 3: The Overriding Particle ばかり
/// When ばかり precedes a noun, the phrase indicates that that is the only thing or person that will do or did the action.

森さんばかり話していた。//Mori-san was the only one talking.
/// I.e., other people did not have a chance to speak.

/// The overriding particle だけ expresses a similar meaning.

森さんだけ話していた。//Only Mori-san was talking.

/// The above sentence with だけ expresses the event as one incident;
/// it is not clear if others wanted to speak.
/// Using ばかり implies that every time the occasion arose to speak, it was Mori who spoke, and he or she did not give others a chance to speak.

/// Compare the following sentences in which ばかり and だけ are used for the direct objects.

あの人は野菜ばかり食べる。//All he eats is vegetables.
あの人は野菜だけ食べる。//He will only eat vegetables.

/// When だけ is used, the sentence says that among the choices that the topic has, he or she chooses only vegetables.
/// This sentence does not imply that this happens every time that the topic eats, which is the implication expressed by ばかり.

/// (2) Complex predicates with ばかりだ
/// When ばかりだ is used in complex predicates, the aspect of the verb before ばかり conveys a specific meaning.

/// # With the positive imperfective form
/// When the verb before ばかりだ is imperfective, ばかり singles the verb out as the only action that the topic will do or does.

/// In the following sentence, the use of the imperfective before ばかりだ indicates that writing the paper still remains to be completed.

卒業までに後はこのレポートを書くばかりです。//The only thing left to do before graduation is to write this paper.

/// The following example indicates that in the past, the student has just had fun and never studied, and implies that this behavior is habitual.

あの学生は遊ぶばかりで、全然、勉強をしない。//That student just goofs off and doesn’t study at all.

/// In either case, however, one action is being singled out.

/// # With the positive perfective form
/// When the verb before ばかりだ is in the perfective, the sentence means that the action was completed recently.

祖母は退院したばかりです。//My grandmother was discharged from the hospital just a little while ago.

/// This usage of ばかりだ is very similar to the use of complex predicates with ところだ.
/// The difference between the two will be discussed in the following section.

/// (3) Difference between ところだ and ばかりだ
/// Complex predicates with ばかりだ and ところだ are quite similar, especially when the verb is in the perfective form.
/// Sentences with ところだ assume that no time has passed between the completion of an event and the time of speaking,
/// while those with ばかりだ indicate that the event was completed recently,
/// so a short period of time may have passed between the completion of an event and the time of speaking.

/// In the following examples, because of these meaning differences,
/// the sentence with ところだ might be used on the day of the wedding,
/// while the one with ばかりだ would be used after a short period of time has passed.

兄は結婚したところです。//My brother just got married.
兄は結婚したばかりです。//My brother just got married.

/// The following example indicates that the time between when the computer was bought and when it broke was short:

このコンピュータは、買ったばかりなのに、もう壊れてしまった。//We just bought this computer, but it’s already broken.

/// In this case, the use of ところだ is inappropriate because the sentence with ところだ indicates that the action of buying was only just completed.

/// (4) Fixed expressions with ばかりじゃなく ~ も
/// The expression ばかりじゃ（or では）なく and も means something similar to “not only . . . but also . . .”
/// The first part may be ばかりではなく, ばかりでなく, or ばかりじゃなく, in order from most to least formal:

あの人はきれいなばかりではなく、頭もとてもいい。//Not only is she pretty, but she is also very smart.
あの人はほとんど何も食べないばかりでなく、水も飲まない。//Not only is he not eating, but he’s not even drinking water.
外国語は話すことが難しいばかりじゃなく、書くこともとても難しい。//Not only is speaking in a foreign language difficult, but writing is, as well.

/// (5) ばかり with numbers
/// ばかり can also be used after numbers, indicating that the number is approximate.
/// This is similar to the use of ぐらい.
/// The difference is that ばかり has the combined meaning of “only” and “approximately” whereas ぐらい indicates only approximation.
/// Because of this meaning, the number with ば かり gives the sense that the number mentioned is a small amount, at least to the speaker.

二分ばかり待っていたら、田村さんが来た。//I only waited for Tamura-san for about two minutes, and then he came.

/// 4: Complex Predicates with だけだ
/// The overriding particle だけ is also used in complex predicates.

/// (1) With the imperfective form
/// When the verb used immediately before だけ is in the imperfective form,
/// the structure indicates that the only thing to be done is what the verb indicates:

旅行の準備は全部した。後は、母に電話をするだけだ。//I’ve done everything in preparation for the trip. The only thing left to do is to call my mother.

/// The verb before だけ may also be nominalized by こと, as in the following:

旅行の準備は全部した。後は、母に電話をすることだけだ。//I’ve done everything in preparation for the trip. Now I just have to call my mother.

/// The difference between the verb with こと and without it is very slight, especially when only one verb is used.
/// Using こと allows more than one verb to be listed in the sentence, however.

旅行の準備は全部した。後は、母に電話をすることと銀行に行くことだけだ。//I’ve done everything in preparation for the trip. Now I just have to call my mother and go to the bank.

/// (2) With the perfective form
/// When the verb used immediately before だけ is in the perfective form,
/// the structure indicates that the only thing the topic did is what the verb indicates:

スミスさんに宿題の漢字を教えてあげただけなのに、お礼にと言って、高いコンサートの切符を送ってくれた。//All I did was to help Smith-san with the kanji in her assignment; she gave me an expensive concert ticket in return.
彼に頼んだのに、彼は黙って、向こうに行っただけだった。//I asked him, but he just left without saying a word.

/// # The difference between だけだ and ばかりだ
/// Complex predicates with だけだ and ばかりだ are similar when the verb that precedes them is in the imperfective.
/// With だけだ, the meaning focus is that the only action the topic takes is to respond.
/// When ばかりだ is used, it is possible to interpret the sentence as meaning that each time someone asks, the topic responds.

あの人は返事をするだけで、後は何もしない。//When asked, all he does is respond; he never does anything.
あの人は返事をするばかりで、後は何もしない。//Whenever he is asked, all he does is respond; he never does anything.

カンバセーション。

/// (1) Promise

森君、来ませんねえ。約束の時間を間違えたんでしょうか。//Mori-kun isn’t here yet. I wonder if he got the appointment time wrong.
森君にかぎって、そんなことはありませんよ。昨日、ちゃんと覚えてましたよ。もうすぐ、来るんじゃないでしょうか。//He wouldn’t do something like that. He remembered it yesterday. I’m sure he’ll be here soon.

/// # 森君にかぎって、そんなことはありませんよ
/// かぎって comes from the verb 限（かぎ）る “to limit.”
/// Used adverbially, this entire sentence means “Mori-kun won’t do something like that,”
/// and 森君にかぎって expresses the notion that “of all people, it would never be Mori-kun who . . .”

/// # 来るんじゃないでしょうか
/// This sentence means “He’ll probably come soon”;
/// literally, “Isn’t it the case that he will come?”

/// (2) Forgetfulness

困ったわねえ。さっき、言ったばっかりなのに、もう忘れてる。//How annoying! I just told him, and he’s forgotten already.
彼、この頃、忙しすぎるんですよ。//I think he’s really busy these days.
そうかもしれないわねえ。//He must be.

/// # さっき、言ったばっかりなのに
/// ばっかり is a colloquial spoken form of ばかり.
/// This clause means “I just told him or her a little while ago, but in spite of that . . .”

/// (3) Perfect timing

今から、食事なんですか。僕、ちょうどいいところに来ましたねえ。//Are you eating now? I came at the right time, didn’t I?
ちゃっかりしてるんだなあ。//Oh! You’re shameless!

/// # ちょうどいいところに
/// ところ here does not refer to a physical place.
/// It refers to a “place in time.”

/// # ちゃっかりする
/// It may be impossible to capture the concept of this phrase with a single word in English,
/// but it refers to the following kind of behavior:
/// when a person easily or readily takes advantage of the other person’s work,
/// then that kind of behavior is expressed as ちゃっかりする.

/// (4) Polite apologies

先日は申し訳ございませんでした。//I’m so sorry about the other day.
いいえ、とんでもございません。こちらこそ失礼致しました。//Oh, no, not at all. I’m the one who should apologize.

/// # 先日
/// This is a more formal version of この間（あいだ）, “the other day.”

/// # 申し訳ございません
/// 申し訳 {もうしわけ} means “excuse”;
/// 申し訳ありません literally means that “I have no excuse,” and thus the expression is used to express an apology.
/// 申し訳ございません is more polite than 申し訳ありません, which was introduced in Stage 2–3.

/// # とんでもございません
/// This is a very polite way of responding when someone offers thanks or an apology.
/// This expression means something like “there is no need to thank me/apologize to me.”
/// Even when ありません is used instead of ございません as in とんでもありません, the expression is still quite formal.
