stage ４，１。

<br>

/// The following points should be understood:

/// 1. Long sentences are nothing more than combinations of smaller parts (words, phrases, clauses, and sentences).

/// The structures of long sentences may be either compound or complex.

/// In the case of long and complex sentences,

/// it is important to be able to figure out which clauses are dependent or independent and whether the dependent clauses are adjectival or adverbial.

<br>

/// 2. In discourse, topics and other elements are often deleted,

/// and it is important to be able to identify those deleted elements.

<br>

/// 3. Students who check the meaning of new words in a dictionary should keep in mind that the English meaning that is given for the word will not share the exact same properties of meaning as the Japanese word.

/// There is really no dictionary that can provide all the information needed for an accurate understanding of each word,

/// but students can ask their instructors questions that will help them to grasp the precise nuances.

<br>

/// 4. Just as Japanese and English words do not translate exactly, neither do grammatical structures.

/// Just because certain structures are used in English does not guarantee that the same structures are used in Japanese.

<br>

/// 5. The speaker’s point of view and/or interpretation are built into many Japanese sentences.

/// Students need to pay great attention to the use of complex predicates to add these nuances of the speaker’s view.

<br>

/// 6. Do not get discouraged if words or kanji learned earlier prove difficult to remember.

/// The most frequently used words and kanji will stay in one’s memory longer, but once learned, they will come back if used again.

/// They will be easier to remember if the student has seen them even once; twice is better than once, three times is better than twice, and so on.

/// Students should not feel frustrated when they forget what they have learned.

/// Frustration is a great hindrance to learning.

<br>



# Stage 4-1 Adverbial Clauses

<br>

## 1: Adverbial Clauses with 限り

/// 限り {かぎり} used in adverbial clauses comes from the verb 限る {かぎる}, which means “to limit.”

/// The verb preceding かぎり in adverbial clauses should be in the imperfective form.

/// An adverbial clause with かぎり expresses a condition limited to what is expressed in that clause.

<br>

あなたがここにいるかぎり、私は勉強できません。//As long as you are here, I cannot study.

あなたが僕に英語を話すかぎり、僕の日本語は上手にならないと思います。//So long as you speak English to me, I believe that my Japanese will not improve.

あなたは、お酒をやめないかぎり、元気になりませんよ。//You will not be healthy, as long as you do not quit drinking.

<br>

#### ~にかぎって

/// The adverbial phrase ~にかぎって also derives from the verb 限る.

/// The statement made in the main clause applies only to the person or a thing expressed in ~にかぎって.

<br>

田中さんにかぎって、そんなことを言うはずがない。//There is no way that Tanaka-san would say such a thing.

<br>

## 2: Adverbial Clauses with 結果

/// 結果 {けっか}, used as a noun in this structure, means “result.”

<br>

先週、試験を受けましたが、その結果はまだ分かりません。//I took the examination last week, but I don’t know its result yet.

<br>

/// 結果 can also be used as a sentential conjunction.

<br>

一生懸命に勉強しました。その結果、試験に合格しました。//I studied hard. As a result, I passed the exam.

<br>

/// 結果 may also be used in adverbial clauses.

/// The meaning of the adverbial clause with this 結果 is the reason for the result expressed in the main clause.

<br>

毎日、五時間、練習した結果、今回は試合に勝つことができました。//I was able to win the competition this time as a result of having practiced five hours a day.

<br>

## 3: Adverbial Clauses with 頃

/// The word 頃, pronounced ごろ, has already been introduced in Stage 1–4 with specific times, as follows.

<br>

今は三時頃でしょうか。//Is it around 3:00 now?

<br>

/// 頃may be used as a time adverb, but in this case it is pronounced ころ and never ごろ.

/// ころ in this use is normally written in hiragana rather than kanji.

<br>

あなたは三年前、日本にいたのですか。私はそのころ中国で勉強していました。//So, you were in Japan three years ago? I was studying in China around that time.

<br>

/// ころ may also be used in adverbial clauses.

/// This clause expresses another event occurring around the time the event expressed in the main clause occurred or will occur.

<br>

あなたが日本に着いたころ、私はまだ寝ていました。//Around the time you arrived in Japan, I was still asleep.

私がドイツで勉強しているころは、あなたはもうそこにはいませんね。//Around the time I will be studying in Germany, you will no longer be there, will you?

<br>

## 4: Adverbial Clauses with 際

/// 際 {さい}, when used as a sentential conjunction, is very similar in meaning to 時 {とき}.

/// The use of 際 is, however, rather formal.

<br>

来年、日本にいらっしゃるんですか。その際には、是非、うちにもいらして下さい。//You will come to Japan next year? Do come visit us, if you come at that time.

<br>

/// When 際 is used in an adverbial clause, the clause expresses the time when the event described in the main clause has occurred or will occur.

/// The use of 際 here is also very similar to 時, but it is more formal.

<br>

日本にいらした際には、是非、お立ち寄りください。//When you come to Japan, please do visit us.

<br>

## 5: Adverbial Clauses with 次第

/// The adverbial clause with 次第 {しだい} expresses a time condition for an event referred to in the main clause.

/// The sentence with this adverbial clause explains that the event expressed in the main clause occurred or will occur as soon as the event described in the adjectival clause is complete.

/// The predicate of this adverbial clause must be formed by combining the stem of a verb and 次第 {しだい}.

<br>

朝ご飯が終わり次第、仕事に出かけます。//As soon as I finish my breakfast, I will leave for work.

<br>

/// Using the adverb すぐに “immediately” instead of the adverbial clause with 次第 conveys a similar meaning.

/// The adverb すぐに modifies the main clause,

/// and the adverbial clause may be expressed by such forms as the たら-form or て-form.

<br>

朝ご飯が終わったら、すぐに仕事に出かけます。//As soon as I finish my breakfast, I will leave for work.

朝ご飯が終わって、すぐに仕事に出かけます。//As soon as I finish my breakfast, I will leave for work.

<br>

/// There are differences between the two structures,

/// the one with the adverbial clause with 次第 and the other with the adverb すぐに.

/// One difference is the level of formality.

/// 次第 is used in more formal situations than すぐに.

/// Another difference is time.

/// The length of the interval between the end of the event expressed in the adverbial clause and the beginning of the event expressed in the main clause is shorter in sentences with 次第 than in those with すぐに.

<br>

#### Noun with 次第

/// In addition to its use in the adverbial clause, 次第 may be used to mean “something is up to/depends on the noun.”

<br>

いつ行きましょうか。//When shall we go?

あなた次第です。//It is up to you.

成功するかしないかは彼の能力次第です。//Whether we will succeed or not depends on his ability.

<br>

## 6: Adverbial Clauses with 瞬間

/// 瞬間 {しゅんかん} means “a moment.”

/// So, when an adverbial clause with 瞬間 is used in a sentence, the events described in the two clauses occur very close to each other.

<br>

ここに着いた瞬間、雨が降り出した。//The moment I arrived here, it began to rain.

<br>

/// 瞬間 can also be used as a sentential conjunction, which means “at that moment.”

<br>

稲妻が走った。その瞬間、うちの中の電気が全部、消えてしまった。//Lightning flashed. At that moment, all the lights in the house went out.

<br>

## 7: Adverbial Clauses with ために

/// The first two uses of ために in the following were introduced in Stages 2–4 and 2–5, but the third structure is new.

<br>

#### Beneficiary phrase

/// ために used after a noun indicates that the preceding noun is the beneficiary of the event expressed in the sentence.

<br>

母のために、この手紙を書いています。//I am writing this letter for my mother.

子供のために、たくさんお金を貯めたいと思っています。//I want to save a lot of money for my children.

<br>

#### Purpose clause (imperfective predicates)

/// ために used in an adverbial clause expresses the purpose of the action expressed in the main clause.

/// In this case, the predicate in the adverbial clause is always in the imperfective.

<br>

来年、日本に行くために、今、日本語を勉強しています。//I am studying Japanese in order to go to Japan next year.

<br>

#### Causal clause (perfective predicates)

/// An adverbial clause with ために, when the predicate of that clause is in the perfective form,

/// is used to give a reason for the event expressed in the main clause.

/// The consequence stated in the main clause in this construction is usually not a positive one.

/// This differs from the other adverbial reason clauses (e.g., から, ので, ~て).

<br>

日本に三年間、住んでいたために、英語の話し方を少し忘れました。//Because I lived in Japan for three years, I forgot a little how to speak English.

あの人はいい教育を受けなかったために、いい仕事に就けなかった。//Because he did not receive good education, he was not able to get a good job.

<br>

## 8: Adverbial Clauses with 度に

/// An adverbial clause with 度に {たびに} indicates that every time the event described in that clause happens,

/// the result is the event described in the main clause.

<br>

私は車に乗るたびに、気分が悪くなる。//Every time I ride in a car, I feel sick.

試験を受けるたびに、勉強が嫌になる。//Every time I take a test, I feel discouraged about my studies.

<br>

/// Adverbial clauses with と express a similar meaning.

/// Recall that the adverbial clause with と expresses natural consequences in the main clause.

/// If a sentence with the adverbial clause with 度（たび）に is used to express a natural consequence, the sentence becomes quite awkward.

/// Compare the following two sentences:

<br>

春が来ると、暖かくなる。//When spring comes, it gets warm.

<br>

/// The above sentence with 度に is awkward because the event expressed in the main clause sounds as if the information is totally new to the listener or the reader of this sentence.

/// 度に, therefore, should be used when the consequence expressed in the main clause is a personal event or experience, as shown below.

<br>

春が来る度に、庭の花を植え替える。//Every spring, I plant new flowers in the garden.

<br>

## 9: Adverbial Clauses with 場合

/// 場合 {ばあい}, a noun meaning “occasion”; “case,” is used either as a sentential conjunction or in adverbial clauses.

<br>

#### As a sentential conjunction

/// When used as a sentential conjunction, it is used with pronouns such as この（その・あの） and こんな （そんな・あんな）.

<br>

薬は飲んでも効かないことがあります。そんな場合には、飲むのを止めてください。//Sometimes medicine does not work. When that happens, you should stop taking it.

<br>

#### In adverbial clauses

/// When 場合 is used in an adverbial clause, the clause with 場合 expresses a certain situation that becomes the condition for the occurrence of another event described in the main clause.

/// The following sentences may sound similar to the sentences with the adjectival clauses with 時,

/// but the clause with 時 specifies a time condition rather than a situation.

<br>

先生が来ない場合は、電話をしてください。//If the teacher does not show up, please call me.

授業を休んだ場合は、次の日に先生に言うことにしています。//I make it a rule to tell my teacher on the following day in the event that I did not go to class.

<br>

## 10: Adverbial clauses with やいなや

/// When やいなや is used in an adverbial clause, an event expressed in the main clause comes immediately after the event expressed in the adverbial clause is complete.

/// Use the imperfective form before やいなや.

<br>

家に帰るやいなや、友達から電話がありました。//As soon as I returned home, I had a phone call from a friend.

<br>

/// Adverbial clauses with やいなや are very similar in meaning to adverbial clauses with 瞬間に {しゅんかんに} and 次第 {しだい}.

/// The following summarizes the meaning and structural differences of the three:

<br>

#### Meaning differences

/// The adverbial clause with 次第に focuses on the completion of the event expressed in the adverbial clause.

/// The adverbial clauses with 瞬間に and やいなや, rather than focusing on the completion,

/// emphasize the short time between the two events described in the adverbial and main clauses.

/// The use of やいなや sounds more formal than the use of 瞬間に.

<br>

#### Predicate forms in the adverbial clauses

/// Pay special attention to the predicate forms when using 次第, 瞬間に, and やいなや in adverbial clauses.

/// Before やいなや, use the imperfective form; before 瞬間に, use the perfective; and before 次第に, use the stem form.
