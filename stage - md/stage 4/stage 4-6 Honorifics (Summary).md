# Stage 4-6 Honorifics (Summary)

<br>

## 1: Honorifics and Politeness

/// The concepts of honorifics and politeness as well as some relevant words are introduced in Stages 1–5, 1–8, 2–6 and other parts of the course.

/// This chapter summarizes these concepts.

<br>

### (1) 待遇表現（たいぐうひょうげん）

<br>

#### 敬語（けいご）, 謙譲語（けんじょうご）, and 丁寧語（ていねいご）

/// 待遇表現（たいぐうひょうげん） is the umbrella term for a language system in which personal relations are reflected in language use.

/// Within this system, 敬語（けいご） is used by a speaker to show respect for the topic referred to,

/// and 謙譲語（けんじょうご） is used to refer to an action or state of the speaker himself or herself in a humble manner,

/// showing respect for the addressee.

<br>

/// As described in Stages 1–5, 1–8, and 2–6, politeness 丁寧語（ていねいご） and honorifics 敬語（けい ご） are related, but with the following distinction.

/// Politeness is determined by the relationship between the speaker and the addressee whereas honorifics address the relationship between the speaker and the topic.

<br>

### (2) Use of plain forms in honorific sentences

/// The use of the plain form indicates a close relationship between the speaker and addressee.

/// For example, the following sentence is used when speaking to a close friend or family member.

<br>

僕は家にいることにするよ。//I will stay at home.

<br>

/// In the sentence below, however, the verb is the honorific verb in the plain form.

/// The reason why the plain form of the verb is used is because the speaker is speaking to a close friend or family member.

/// The honorific verb is used because the verb refers to a topic, the teacher, toward whom the speaker shows his or her respect.

<br>

中村先生はまだ授業にいらっしゃるよ。//Nakamura-sensei is still in class.

<br>

/// The use of ~ます at the end of a verb indicates that the relationship between the speaker and addressee is not close.

<br>

私はもう少し家にいます。//I will stay at home a little longer.

中村先生はまだ授業にいらっしゃいます。//Nakamura-sensei is still in class.

<br>

/// The following shows the parts of a verb that reflect the relationship between the speaker and the addressee, and between the speaker and the topic.

<br>

/// いらっしゃ る いらっしゃい ます 

///    ↓       ↓     ↓        ↓

/// topic  addressee topic  addressee

<br>

#### Speech form used with family members

/// All family members are considered to be うち-group, so neither the polite form nor honorifics should be used when talking to them.

/// When talking about them, honorifics should not be used ( even when they are older than the speaker).

<br>

## 2: Honorific Verbs

<br>

### (1) The honorific いらっしゃる

/// Although this verb, いらっしゃる, is a Group 2 verb, the stem is いらっしゃい rather than いらっしゃり, which was the form used long ago.

/// The polite form therefore is いらっしゃいます rather than いらっし ゃります.

/// The verb いらっしゃる is the honorific form for いる, 行く, and 来る.

<br>

#### The verb いる

<br>

今日はうちにいることにします。//I decided to stay at home today.

中村先生はお宅にいらっしゃいます。//Nakamura-sensei is at home.

<br>

#### The humble おる

/// In a situation where the use of honorifics is preferred, when talking about the speaker herself or himself, the use of the humble form, 謙譲語（けんじょうご）, is most appropriate.

/// The topic of the humble forms must be the speaker or members of the うち group.

/// For instance, the humble form of the verb いる is おる（おります）.

/// By using the humble form, the speaker lowers himself or herself, which results in exalting the addressee.

<br>

/// 先生://Teacher:

「明日はどこにいますか。」//Where will you be tomorrow?

/// 学生://Student:

「私は明日ここにおります。」//I will be here tomorrow.

<br>

#### The verb 行く

<br>

/// （行く）

私は京都に行きます。//I will go to Kyoto.

<br>

/// （いらっしゃる）

先生はイギリスにいらっしゃいます。//The teacher will go to England.

<br>

/// The verb 来る {くる}

<br>

/// （来る）

メアリーさんは三時頃、家に来ます。//Mary will come to my house around 3:00.

<br>

/// （いらっしゃる）

中川先生は夕方、学校にいらっしゃいます。//Nakagawa-sensei will come to school in the evening.

<br>

#### The humble まいる

/// まいる is the humble verb for 行く and 来る.

<br>

私は明日、韓国にまいります。//Tomorrow I will go to Korea.

私の姉もこちらにまいります。//My sister, too, will come here.

<br>

### (2) The verb 言う

/// For the verb 言う {いう}, おっしゃる is the honorific and おっしゃいます the polite form.

/// As in the case of the verb いらっしゃる, the stem is not おっしゃり, despite the fact that it is a Group 2 verb.

/// The stem is おっしゃい.

<br>

先生は漢字は大切だとおっしゃいました。//The teacher said that kanji are very important.

<br>

#### The humble 申す

/// Recall the following expression from the Preparatory Stage chapter. 申す {もうす} in this sentence is the humble form of 言う.

<br>

私は田中と申します。//My names is Tanaka.

/// Literally, “I am called Tanaka.”

<br>

私は明日、行くと先生に申しました。//I told the teacher that I would go tomorrow.

<br>

## 3: Honorifics of Other Classes of Words

<br>

### (1) The copula でいらっしゃる

/// The honorific form of the copula also includes いらっしゃる, but in this case で must precede いらっし ゃる.

<br>

森先生でいらっしゃいますか。//Are you Mori-sensei?

<br>

#### The humble copula でござる

/// The humble form of the copula is でござる. Like いらっしゃる and おっしゃる, the polite form of ござる is ございます rather than ござります.

/// There are, in fact, just five verbs, all in the honorific system, that, like these three verbs, use い rather than り for the polite form.

<br>

私は森でございます。//I am Mori.

<br>

### (2) Honorific nouns

<br>

#### Use of polite prefixes

/// The prefixes of お or ご are added to nouns when the situation requires the speaker to use polite or honorific language.

/// The use of these prefixes, as well as knowing which prefix to use, is complex.

/// The use of お, the polite prefix, is much more prevalent among female speakers,

/// while the use of ご, the honorific prefix, may be used by both male and female speakers.

<br>

/// It is sometimes said that お is used with 大和言葉 {やまとことば} and ご with 漢語 {かんご}, but there are numerous exceptions.

<br>

/// prefix お: お花, お机, お勉強, お仕事

/// prefix ご: ご本, ご兄弟, ご両親, ご親切

<br>

/// In some words, the polite お and the honorific ご have become inseparable parts of the words.

/// Some examples are such words as お茶 {おちゃ} and ご飯 {ごはん}, which are used in both male and female speech.

<br>

#### Separate honorific nouns

/// Some nouns are reserved only for honorifics. お宅（たく） is the honorific word for the noun, 家 {うち}.

/// The second sentence below therefore not only possesses an honorific verb but expresses the place, the teacher’s home, in the honorific form as well.

/// This noun is used by both genders.

<br>

私はうちにいます。//I am at home.

先生はお宅にいらっしゃいます。//The teacher is at home.

<br>

### (3) Honorific pronouns

/// どちら is the honorific of どこ, both of which mean “where,” and どなた together with どちら is the honorific of だれ “who.”

<br>

スミスさんはどこにいますか。//Where is Mr. Smith?

スミス先生はどちらにいらっしゃいますか。//Where is Professor Smith?

<br>

だれがそこにいますか。//Who is there?

どなたがそこにいらっしゃいますか。//Who is there?

<br>

### (4) Honorific adjectives and adjectival nouns

/// As with nouns, the most common way to make adjectives and adjectival nouns into polite forms is to add the polite prefix お or ご.

<br>

お忙しいでしょう？//You must be busy.

先生のお嬢さんはおきれいですね。//Your daughter is very pretty, Professor.

ご親切、感謝します。//I appreciate your kindness.

<br>

/// When describing things, even if they belong to people that the speaker pays respect to,

/// the honorific prefixes お and ご are not used with adjectives and adjectival nouns.

/// For example, it is very strange to describe someone’s bag with an honorific adjective.

<br>

/// If the topic is a person, however, an honorific adjective may be used.

<br>

先生のお子さんはまだお小さいですねえ。//Your child is still very young, isn’t she, sensei?

<br>

#### Humble adjectives

/// Humble adjectives are used only on very formal occasions, and mostly by female speakers.

<br>

/// When the vowel before い is either a or o, change it to long o, and then add ございます, as in the following.

<br>

この靴は私には小そうございます。//These shoes are (too) small for me.

私の着物は青うございます。//My kimono is blue.

<br>

/// When the vowel before い is a u, make it into long u, and then add ございます.

<br>

寒うございます。//I am cold.

<br>

/// When the vowel before い is an i, make it into a long palatalized syllable, and then add ございます.

<br>

忙しゅうございます。//I am busy.

この靴は私には大きゅうございます。//These shoes are (too) big for me.

<br>

## 4: Regular and Irregular Honorific and Humble Forms

<br>

### (1) Irregular forms

/// There are regular and irregular honorific and humble forms.

/// The irregular forms must be memorized (see the chart below).

/// For the regular ones, there are convenient formulas for their formation.

<br>

/// Meaning | Neutral | Honorific | Humble |

/// to be | いる | いらっしゃる（*） | おる |

/// to go | いく | いらっしゃる | まいる |

/// to come | くる | いらっしゃる | まいる |

/// copula | だ | でいらっしゃる | でござる（*） |

/// to be; to possess | ある | おありになる | ござる（*） |

/// to say | いう | おっしゃる（*） | もうす・もうしあげる |

/// to eat; to drink | たべる・のむ | めしあがる | いただく |

/// to see | みる | ごらんになる | はいけんする |

/// to know | しる | ごぞんじだ | ぞんじる |

/// to do | する | なさる（*） | いたす |

<br>

### (*) As in the case of いらっしゃる, おっしゃる, and くださる, the ~ますforms of these verbs are the following: ござる→ございます, なさる→なさいます

<br>

### (2) Regular forms

/// Formula (honorific form) -> お（stem）になる

/// Formula (humble form) -> お（stem）する・いたす

<br>

/// Even when there is an irregular honorific verb, the honorific derived by the above formula may be used.

/// For instance, compare the following:

<br>

田中先生はお昼ご飯をたくさんお食べになりました。//Tanaka-sensei ate a big lunch.

田中先生はお昼ご飯をたくさん召し上がりました。//Tanaka-sensei ate a big lunch.

田中先生はお昼ご飯をたくさんお召し上がりになりました。//Tanaka-sensei ate a big lunch.

<br>

/// Japanese has different degrees of honorifics and quite a few ways to express courtesy and respect.

/// For instance, the verb of the last of the above examples is the most honorific of the three.

/// There are others in addition to those listed above, but not all possible options are presented in this course.

<br>

### (3) Stems of the five honorific verbs

/// The stems of the following five honorific verbs are irregular, as summarized below.

<br>

/// いらっしゃる → いらっしゃい → いらっしゃいます

/// おっしゃる → おっしゃい → おっしゃいます

/// くださる → ください → くださいます

/// なさる → なさい → なさいます

/// ござる → ござい → ございます

<br>

### (4) Regular and irregular humble forms

/// Regular humble forms are more complicated to use than irregular forms.

/// Irregular humble forms may be used just about anytime desired to speak politely.

/// This is not true with the regular humble forms.

<br>

/// The regular humble forms may not be used merely to sound polite when describing what one is doing.

/// They are used only when the speaker does something for someone else.

/// Compare the following two sentences, both of which intend to express that the speaker is reading as her or his own task.

<br>

今、本を読んでおります。//I am reading.

<br>

/// The irregular おります is used in the first sentence, but the regular humble form is used in the second sentence.

/// The reason why the second sentence is not acceptable is because the sentence sounds as if the speaker is reading for someone else.

<br>

/// When offering to do something for someone, one may use the regular humble form because the action is beneficial to the addressee.

<br>

お読みしましょうか。//Shall I read this for you?

<br>

## 5: Passive Forms as Honorific Forms

/// All passive forms, when meaning permits, may also be used as honorific verbs.

/// Expressions formed by the passive forms of verbs are less honorific than such honorific verbs as いらっしゃる.

<br>

/// As in the case of passive and potential, there is normally no meaning confusion among passive, potential, and honorific sentences because of the structural differences of the three types of sentences.

<br>

中村先生はいつもここでコーヒーを飲まれます。//Nakamura-sensei always drinks coffee here.

スミス先生はもう帰られましたか。//Did Smith-sensei return home?

<br>

/// The potential and honorific readings can, however, in some cases be ambiguous if some parts of the sentences are deleted,

/// which often happens in conversation. See the following sentence:

<br>

明日また来られますか。//Are you able to come here again tomorrow?

/// [honorific] “Will you come here again tomorrow?” [potential] “Are you able to come here again tomorrow?”

<br>

#### Notes on the use of honorifics

/// Some use of honorific expressions is expected.

/// In some social settings, although the level of politeness used may be a personal choice, the use of honorifics is expected.

/// An example of such a social setting is a language used by a store clerk in a store.

<br>

/// The use of honorific expressions is a personal choice.

/// Although use of honorifics is preferred in some social settings, it is a personal choice what level of politeness or honorific language to use.

/// Some people use honorific and polite language more often than others, even when they are in identical situations.

<br>

/// Honorific forms are used as polite expressions.

/// Honorifics are often used simply to be polite, and the use has little to do with who the speaker and the addressee are, or who or what the topic is.

/// People from older generations and women tend to use this style more often than others.

<br>

## 6: Examples of Politeness and Honorifics

<br>

### (1) When the topics of a conversation are the speaker and addressee themselves

/// When considering the level of politeness and honorifics to use, the speaker must be aware of the following:

/// 1. the social status of the speaker and the addressee

/// 2. the relationship of the two. These factors are not absolute.

/// In some cases, more subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle factors may need to be considered.

/// Age, for example, is often an important factor.

<br>

#### Situation 1

/// social status – speaker and addressee roughly the same

/// relationship – speaker and addressee know each other but not very well

<br>

/// Speaker:

明日うちにいますか。//Will you be home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

ええ、いますよ。//Yes, I will.

<br>

/// In the above case, the use of ~ます indicates that the two people are not very close,

/// but the use of the verb いる indicates that there is very little difference in their social status,

/// or if there is, the difference is not significant to either the speaker or the addressee.

/// Perhaps the two people who are conversing in this dialogue are working in the same company,

/// but they are not particularly well acquainted.

<br>

/// Here, there is no hard-and-fast rule for the decision to use a certain speech style based on these factors.

/// Even if the objective factors are clear to the speaker and the addressee,

/// the speaker may decide to use a different speech style than the one expected.

/// Because of this, not every possible style the speaker may choose can be illustrated here.

<br>

#### Situation 2

/// social status – speaker and addressee roughly the same

/// relationship – speaker and addressee are close friends

<br>

/// Speaker:

明日うちにいる？//Will you be home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

うん、いるよ。//Yes, I will.

<br>

/// In this case, the plain form is used rather than the ~ます form.

/// The verb ending of the plain form indicates that the relationship between the speaker and the addressee is close.

/// Notice that even the word for “yes” うん is more casual. In other words, not only the verb is affected by the speech style.

/// Note that the same speech style as the one above is used in conversations between members of an immediate family.

/// Although there are certainly differences in social status (and age, of course), these factors need not be considered within one family.

<br>

#### Situation 3

/// social status – speaker (student), addressee (speaker’s teacher)

/// relationship – speaker and addressee have known each other for quite some time

<br>

/// Speaker:

明日お宅にいらっしゃいますか。//Will you be home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

ええ、いますよ。//Yes, I will.

/// or うん、いるよ。

<br>

/// In the student’s speech, the use of the honorific verb indicates that the speaker respects the addressee because of the higher social status the addressee holds.

/// In this speech, even the noun for the addressee’s house is in the honorific form, お宅 {おたく}, rather than 家 {うち}.

/// The verb ending, ~ます, indicates that the speaker maintains the distance that is expected between a student and a teacher despite the fact that they have known each other for quite some time.

<br>

/// The teacher cannot use the honorific verb here because he/she is speaking to his/her student about himself/herself.

/// Therefore, the verb, いる or います, is used.

/// The choice between the polite form and the plain form depends on the teacher.

/// Women in Japan generally tend to speak more politely than men, and it is therefore quite possible to find a female teacher using います and a male teacher using いる.

/// It is not strange to see a teacher using the ~ます form with a student.

/// A male teacher, on the other hand, may choose to speak more casually even to a student.

<br>

/// The following examples of relationships between the speaker and the addressee are equivalent to the one given above:

<br>

/// 1. speaker (student), addressee (the speaker’s friend’s parent(s))

/// 2. speaker (company employee), addressee (speaker’s boss, or anyone of a higher rank)

/// 3. speaker (store clerk), addressee (customer)

<br>

/// The last case is interesting.

/// The speaker (store clerk) will always use the honorific verb in the polite form when speaking to the addressee (even if the clerk is older or in a higher social rank).

/// It is a social convention in Japan for store clerks to show respect for their customers, regardless of their social status and age.

<br>

/// Situation 4

/// social status – speaker (teacher), addressee (student)

/// relationship – speaker and addressee have known each other for quite some time

<br>

/// Speaker:

明日、うちにいますか。//Will you be home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

ええ、おります。//Yes, I will.

<br>

/// The humble form is used when talking about oneself in the presence of a respected addressee.

<br>

### (2) When the topic is a third party not present in the conversation

<br>

#### Situation 1

/// social status – speaker (student), addressee (student), topic (student)

/// relationship – speaker, addressee and topic do not know each other very well

<br>

/// Speaker:

田中さんは明日うちにいますか。//Will Tanaka-san be home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

ええ、いますよ。//Yes, he will.

<br>

/// Situation 2

/// social status – speaker (student), addressee (student), topic (student)

/// relationship – speaker, addressee, and topic are close friends

<br>

/// Speaker:

田中さんは明日うちにいる？//Will Tanaka-san be home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

うん、いるよ。//Yes, he will.

<br>

/// Situation 3

/// social status – speaker (student), addressee (student), topic (teacher)

/// relationship – speaker and addressee are not very close

<br>

/// Speaker:

田中先生は明日お宅にいらっしゃいますか。//Will Tanaka-sensei be at home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

ええ、いらっしゃいますよ。//Yes, he will be.

<br>

/// Since both students are talking about the teacher, both use the honorific verb.

/// The polite form is used because the speaker and the addressee are not close.

<br>

/// Situation 4

/// social status – speaker (student), addressee (student), topic (teacher)

/// relationship – speaker and addressee know each other quite well

<br>

/// Speaker:

田中先生は明日お宅にいらっしゃる？//Will Tanaka-sensei be at home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

うん、いらっしゃるよ。//Yes, he will be.

<br>

/// In the above conversation, both the speaker and the addressee use the honorific verb because both are talking about their teacher.

/// However, they use the plain form because the speaker and the addressee know each other quite well.

<br>

/// Situation 5

/// social status – speaker (teacher), addressee (student), topic (addressee’s mother)

/// relationship – there is social distance between speaker and addressee

<br>

/// Speaker:

お母さんは明日うちにいますか。//Will your mother be at home tomorrow?

/// or お母さんは明日お宅にいらっしゃいますか。

<br>

/// Addressee:

はい、おります。//Yes, she will be.

<br>

/// The teacher can use either neutral polite or honorific polite speech. The choice is entirely up to him or her.

/// It is important to notice that the student uses the humble verb despite the fact that he/she is not talking about himself/herself.

/// Since the speaker refers to his/her own mother, the verb form is humble in the presence of someone the speaker respects.
