# Stage 4-8 On Words and Vocabulary

<br>

## 1: Complex Words

/// One way to join words is to join the stem of a predicate and another element,

/// and several examples of these complex words have been introduced in Stage 2–6.

/// This section lists a few more.

<br>

### (1) ~がい

/// A verb stem with がい refers to an “[action] worth doing.”

<br>

生きがいのある仕事を持てることはとても幸せなことです。//Anyone who has a job that he finds fulfilling is lucky indeed.

/// or she

<br>

/// As introduced in Stage 2–4, both やる and する mean “to do.”

/// やる is used in casual conversation.

/// In complex words with ~がい, however, やる rather than する is normally used.

<br>

この仕事は本当にやりがいがある。//This is a job that is really worth doing.

<br>

### (2) ~がち

/// The suffix ~がち comes from the verb 勝つ {かつ} “to win.”

/// The complex words with this suffix have the meaning of “tendency to (verb).”

<br>

あの人はどちらかというと憂鬱になりがちです。//That person tends to get depressed.

<br>

### (3) Combinations of more than two elements

/// An almost infinite number of meanings can be expressed by combining two words, with the first word in the stem form.

<br>

/// 寒過ぎる “too cold”

/// 書きやすい “easy to write”

/// 書きやすい “easy to write”

/// 払い忘れる “forget to pay”

/// 待ち疲れる “tired of waiting”

/// 雨が降り止む “stop raining”

<br>

/// More than two elements can be combined.

/// For example, the combination 読みやすそう consists of the verb 読む, the adjective やすい, and the adjectival noun そう, and means the following.

<br>

この本は読みやすそうですね。//This book looks easy to read.

これは食べにくそうですね。//This looks hard to eat.

雨が降り出しそうですね。//It seems as if it is about to rain.

<br>

## 2: Derived Words

/// Words in one category can sometimes be converted into another in a predictable manner.

/// Some examples are given below.

<br>

### (1) ~さ

/// Descriptive words, which are mostly adjectives and adjectival nouns (and a few nouns such as color terms),

/// can express the degree of description by adding the suffix ~さ.

/// As for adjectives, drop the final い and add さ, and for nouns and adjectival nouns, add さ to the original word.

<br>

/// 高い -> 高さ height

/// 重い -> 重さ weight

/// いい -> よさ goodness

/// 静か -> 静かさ（静けさ）* quietness

/// 便利 -> 便利さ convenience

/// 白 -> 白さ whiteness

<br>

/// * Both 静（しず）かさ and 静（しず）けさ are acceptable, but the latter is more common.

<br>

この国の値段の高さには本当に参ってしまった。//I am quite discouraged by the high price of things in this country.

ここの静けさが気に入っている。//I am fond of the serenity of this place.

<br>

### (2) ~的

/// Some nouns may be changed into adjectival nouns by adding the suffix ~的 {てき}.

/// For example, when ~的 {てき} is added to 日本 as in 日本的 {にほんてき},

/// this derived adjectival noun indicates that the thing or the person that the speaker describes has “defining characteristics of things or persons in Japan.”

<br>

あの女性は本当に日本的ですねえ。//That woman is very Japanese, isn’t she?

あの中国的な建物は何ですか。//What is that Chinese-looking building?

<br>

### (3) ~ぽい

/// When the suffix ~ぽい is added to a noun (the /p/ of ぽい is often doubled),

/// the derived adjective is used to describe something or someone having pronounced attributes of the noun used with ~ぽい.

/// For example, 子供っぽい {こどもっぽい} indicates that someone is “childish.”

/// The derived meaning is not necessarily negative, but it is often used in a negative way.

/// The derived adjectives are colloquial.

<br>

あの男性はいつまでも子供っぽいですねえ。//That man acts forever the child, doesn’t he?

<br>

### (4) 真~

/// The prefix 真~ {ま~}, when added to some descriptive words, indicates an extreme degree.

/// The consonant immediately after 真~ is usually doubled, and may be written with the small つ between the two kanji, as seen below.

/// For the noun 赤 {あか}, the first vowel あ disappears and the consonant /k/ of か is doubled.

/// For the noun 青 {あお}, the consonant /s/, doubled, is inserted between 真 and 青.

<br>

/// 赤 -> 真っ赤・真赤 bright red

/// 青 -> 真っ青・真青 deep blue

/// 白 -> 真っ白･真白 pure white

/// 黒 -> 真っ黒・真黒 pitch black

/// 中 -> 真ん中・真中 dead center

/// 正面 -> 真正面* directly in front

/// 先 -> 真っ先・真先 immediately; right away

/// 夏 -> 真夏 midsummer

/// 冬 -> 真冬 midwinter

<br>

/// * Also ましょうめん without doubling the consonant /sy(sh)/.

<br>

/// For color terms, when 真~ is added, the word category changes from a noun （赤 {あか} is a noun） to an adjectival noun, 真っ赤 {まっか}.

<br>

あの赤のセーターはだれのですか。//Whose is that red sweater?

あの真っ赤なセーターはだれのですか。//Whose is that bright red sweater?

<br>

/// (5) Fixed derived words

/// As examples, the following two fixed expressions contain the old negative ず.

<br>

#### 食べずぎらい

/// ぎらい comes from 嫌い {きらい} “not fond of (something).”

/// This fixed phrase means one “does not like a certain food, even without trying it.”

<br>

あの子は食べずぎらいの食べ物がとても多いです。//That child dislikes many kinds of foods without ever trying them.

<br>

#### 見ず知らず {みずしらず}

/// This expression, combining 見ず {みず} “not to see” and 知らず “not to know,” is used to describe “a total stranger.”

<br>

見ず知らずの他人を頼ることもできませんから、外国で生活をするのは大変です。//I found it difficult to live abroad, because I do not want to rely on total strangers.

<br>

## 3: The Verb する

/// The verb する has been presented thus far as meaning “to do,” but it has many other functions.

/// One of them is to describe a person.

<br>

/// When describing current occupations, for example, する is used in the continuous aspect, している.

<br>

私の母は高校の先生をしています。//My mother works as a teacher.

私の姉は花屋をしています。//My sister has a flower shop.

<br>

/// Note that independent occupations are not expressed with している.

<br>

/// In this case, it should be expressed with the copula.

<br>

姉は作家です。//My sister is a writer.

<br>

### (2) Describing facial and bodily features

/// A very common mistake is to describe facial and bodily features using the verb ある.

<br>

/// This misuse of あります is influenced by the use of have in the English sentence, “that woman has long hair.”

/// Use either the verb する (in the form of している) or the topic-subject structure (see Stage 1–7).

<br>

あの女性は長い髪をしています。//That woman has long hair.

あの女性は髪が長いです。//That woman has long hair.

<br>

/// The difference between the two sentences above is not very great,

/// but the first sentence with している describes a temporary state while the second sentence with the topic-subject structure indicates a more permanent one.

/// For instance, the use of している is better when saying that someone’s face is red due to drinking,

/// because the use of the topic-subject structure sounds as if the topic always has a red face.

<br>

飲みすぎて、あの人は赤い顔をしています。//That person has a red face because he drank too much.

<br>

## 4: Negative ~ぬ

/// In some formal speech or writing, ~ぬ may be used in place of the negative ~ない, as, for example, in the following constructions.

<br>

これはだれにも話さぬように、お願いします。//I would like to ask that you not tell anyone about this.

間違いをくりかえさぬために、ここに書いておこう。//I will write it down so that I will not make a mistake.

<br>

/// This negative, like ~ず, is an old form.

/// The ぬ-negatives of the Group 3 verbs, する and くる, are せぬ and こぬ.

/// The ず-negative may be used with に to form an adverbial phrase but ~ぬmay not.

/// Likewise, the ぬ-negative may be used with a functional noun such as よう, but ~ず may not.

<br>

## 5: Kanji Compounds

<br>

### (1) 漢語

/// As explained in Stage 2–5, the use of 漢語 {かんご} rather than 大和言葉 {やまとことば} normally adds formality to speech and writings, although there are some exceptions.

/// For instance, the following two sentences have the same meaning, but the one with 大和言葉 sounds more casual than the one with 漢語.

<br>

私はあなたのことが全く分かりません。//I really don’t understand you at all.

私はあなたのことが全く理解できません。//I really don’t understand you at all.

<br>

#### 漢語 formation

/// The structure of 漢語 is often related to the equivalent phrases in Japanese.

<br>

/// “to read books” 本を読む →  “reading” 読書 {どくしょ}

<br>

/// 自分で習う 自習 self-learning

/// 山に登る 登山 mountain climbing

/// ご飯を炊く 炊飯 cook rice

/// 人を殺す 殺人 kill others

<br>

/// Such pairs cannot be found for every expression, but they are quite numerous.

<br>

#### 最~

/// Knowing the components of kanji compounds is quite useful.

/// For instance, when the kanji prefix 最~ {さい} is added to another kanji, the compound expresses the superlative.

<br>

/// 最高 さいこう highest; best 

/// 最低 さいてい lowest; worst

/// 最大 さいだい biggest

/// 最小 さいしょう smallest

<br>

#### 以~

/// The kanji prefix 以~ {い} marks a level for measurement.

/// The measure is specified by a specific number that is used before the kanji compound with this prefix.

<br>

/// 以上 いじょう more than

/// 以下 いか (fewer) than

/// 以前 いぜん before

/// 以後 いご after

/// 以内 いない within

/// 以外 いがい except

<br>

子供に学校には五百円以上お金を持たせないでください。//Please do not allow your child to bring more than 500 yen to school.

３０分以内にこちらに来てください。//Please come here within half an hour.

<br>

### (2) 四字熟語

/// Many kanji compounds are made up of four kanji, called 四字熟語 {よじじゅくご}.

/// Dictionaries that focus on the meanings and usages of these compounds are called 四字熟語辞典 {よじじゅくごじてん}.

<br>

/// 春夏秋冬 {しゅんかしゅうとう}

/// spring, summer, fall, winter

/// four seasons

<br>

/// 東西南北 {とうざいなんぼく}

/// east, west, south, north

/// in all directions

<br>

/// 喜怒哀楽 {きどあいらく}

/// happy, mad, sad, fun

/// the range of human feelings

<br>

/// 弱肉強食 {じゃくにくきょうしょく}

/// strong animals eat weak ones

/// the survival of the fittest

<br>

/// 以心伝心 {いしんでんしん}

/// communicating without words

/// non-verbal communication

<br>

/// 一石二鳥 {いっせきにちょう}

/// kill two birds with one stone

/// accomplish two things at once

<br>

/// 自画自賛 {じがじさん}

/// praise one’s own painting

/// self admiration

<br>

/// 自業自得 {じごうじとく}

/// one receives punishment for one’s own deeds

/// consequence of one’s own action

<br>

## 6: Rules for Transitive-Intransitive Verb Pairs

/// Several transitive-intransitive pairs of words have been introduced, one of which is given as an example below,

/// in which 出す {だす} “to take (something out)” is transitive while 出る {でる} “to go out” is intransitive.

<br>

お姉さんは犬を外に出しました。//My sister let the dog outside.

犬が外に出ました。//The dog went outside.
