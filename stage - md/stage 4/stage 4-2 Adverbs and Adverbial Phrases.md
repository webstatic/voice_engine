# Stage 4-2 Adverbs and Adverbial Phrases

<br>

## 1: What Do Adverbs and Adverbial Phrases Do?

/// Adverbs are single words, but adverbial phrases and clauses consist of more than one word.

/// Adverbial phrases cannot stand alone, but adverbial clauses contain the same minimum elements as sentences.

/// Adverbs and adverbial phrases add a great deal of information to what the speaker or the writer wishes to convey.

<br>

/// For instance, to express different ways to “walk,” English speakers may use different verbs,

/// e.g., “stroll,” “trail,” “stride,” “hobble,” “waddle,” among others.

/// Japanese speakers tend to rely on a single verb 歩く, combined with various adverbs (including onomatopoeia) to express different ways of walking.

<br>

/// 歩く “walk”, ぶらぶら歩く “stroll”, 足をひきずって歩く “limp”,  大またに歩く “stride”,

/// びっこをひいて歩く “hobble”, よたよた歩く “waddle”, よちよち歩く “toddle” (e.g., infants)

<br>

/// There are obviously too many adverbs and adverbial phrases to list here,

/// so the list is limited to some common onomatopoeia and adverbial phrases, especially fixed phrases.

<br>

## 2: Onomatopoeia

/// The use of onomatopoeia enriches expressions, especially when speaking.

/// They are best learned with the appropriate verb, especially when they are used adverbially.

/// The list of onomatopoeia below therefore gives the verbs they are associated with.

<br>

/// ワンワン泣く cry (bawling), シクシク泣く cry (sobbing), エーンエーン泣く cry (baby),

/// ゲラゲラ笑う laugh aloud,

/// にっこり笑う smile (brief; fleeting), にこにこ笑う smile (beaming),

/// こっくりこっくり寝る sleep (nod or doze), ぐうぐう寝る sleep (soundly), ぐうすか寝る sleep (carefree; snoring),

/// がたがた震える tremble (large shakes), ぶるぶる震える tremble (shiver),

/// ジーっと見る stare (one place), じろじろ見る stare (eyes moving around),

/// ぶつぶつ文句を言う complain (by mumbling), くどくど文句を言う complain (naggingly; repeatedly),

/// びしょびしょに濡れる get wet (could be a part of the body), びっしょり濡れる get wet (the entire body),

/// じりじり暑い hot (scorching), ぽかぽか暖かい warmth (from sunshine),

/// 汗をたらたら流す sweat (dripping sweat), 汗がじっとり出る sweat (light sweat; no dripping)

<br>

## 3: Adverbial Phrases with ~ずに

/// The adverbial use of ~ないで was introduced in Stage 2–1,

/// and sentences with this expression mean that the action described in the main clause was or will be achieved without completing the action described in the adverbial phrase.

/// Equivalent to the ~ない negative, the ~ず negative is an older way to indicate the negative of verbs.

/// Adding the particle に, ~ずに sounds more formal than ~ないで in both writing and speech.

<br>

朝ご飯を食べないで（食べずに）、学校に行きました。//I went to school without eating breakfast.

両親に言わないで（言わずに）、大学院の入学試験を受けました。//I took an entrance examination for graduate school without telling my parents.

<br>

/// The ~ず negative forms of する and くる are せず and こず, respectively.

<br>

宿題をせずに、授業に行った。//I went to class without doing my homework.

お金を持ってこずに、買い物に行きました。//I went shopping, but didn’t take any money.

<br>

## 4: Fixed Phrases

/// Fixed adverbial phrases come up all the time in reading and conversation and are valuable to learn.

/// The phrases listed here as examples are some of the more common ones.

<br>

### (1) 生まれながらにして

/// Using the verb 生まれる {うまれる}, meaning “to be born,”

/// this phrase means “at birth”; “by birth”; “from birth,” etc.

<br>

あの子は生まれながらにして、音楽の才能に恵まれているようですね。//That child is naturally talented in music.

あの学生は生まれながらにして、語学の才能があるのでしょうか。//Do you think that student has a gift for languages?

<br>

### (2) 思い切って

/// 思い切る {おもいきる} is a complex verb, consisting of the verb 思う {おもう} “to think” and 切る {きる} “to cut.”

/// The combination literally means “to cut thinking”; that is “to stop thinking and decide.”

/// When used adverbially, the verb must be in the conjunctive form.

<br>

思い切って、日本に行くことにしました。//I wasn’t sure in the beginning, but I made up my mind to go to Japan.

してみないと結果は分かりませんから、思い切って、やってみて下さい。//Since you don’t know what will happen unless you try, you should just give it a try.

<br>

### (3) 思わず・・・~てしまう

/// 思わず {おもわず} contains the ~ずnegative which was explained above.

/// When 思わず is used adverbially, the sentence often ends with ~てしまう to convey that the result has been achieved unintentionally.

<br>

あまりまずかったので、思わず文句を言ってしまった。//It tasted so bad that I complained without stopping to think.

とてもなつかしく、思わず叫んでしまった。//It was so nostalgic, I shouted out loud (without thinking).

<br>

### (4) 正直なところ

/// 正直 {しょうじき} is an adjectival noun meaning “honest.”

/// This word may be used alone as an adverb for the entire sentence or with ところ, meaning “my honest feeling right now.”

/// The following examples show two different ways of using this word or phrase.

/// The expression 正直言う carries the same meaning.

<br>

正直（なところ）、私はもうこんな所で働きたくないと思っています。//Honestly speaking, I no longer want to work at this kind of place.

正直言って、私はもうこんな所で働きたくないと思っています。//Honestly speaking, I no longer want to work at this kind of place.

<br>

### (5) ただ一人

/// ただ一人 {ただ ひとり} in itself is not a fixed expression, but it illustrates that only very small numbers can follow the adverb ただ.

/// ただ emphasizes the smallness of the number before it.

/// “Small” of course is relative to the context.

/// “One” may be a small number in one context, and in another, “one hundred” may be small.

<br>

僕の寮では菜食主義者の学生は、僕、ただ一人だけだった。//In my dorm, I was the only student who was a vegetarian.

<br>

### (6) たった一人

/// This phrase is almost the same as the expression with ただ.

/// たった is more colloquial than ただ, but it emphasizes aloneness or emptiness even more.

<br>

家の者は皆、出てしまって、たった一人ぽっちになってしまった。//Everyone in the family had left, and I was all alone.

<br>

### (7) ひょっとすると

/// The fixed phrase ひょっとする may be used to express the following nuance: “possibly”; “by chance.”

/// Because the phrase expresses ambiguity, the predicate of a sentence with this phrase often contains かもしれない or some similar ending.

<br>

ひょっとすると、彼が今日、帰ってくるかもしれない。//It just might happen that he will come home today.

ひょっとすると、あの人は私が言ったことが分かっていなかったのだろうか。//It is quite possible that he didn’t understand what I told him.

<br>

### (8) ふいに

/// The adverbial phrase ふいに consists of the noun 不意（ふい） and the particle に.

/// The noun 不意（ふ い） literally means “suddenness; unexpectedness.”

/// ふいにused adverbially indicates an event occurs or has occurred “suddenly”; “abruptly”; “without warning.”

<br>

彼はふいに外に出て行った。//Abruptly he went outside.

彼女のことをふいに思い出した。//I suddenly started thinking about her.

<br>

### (9) ふと

/// This adverb indicates that the action following this adverb was done spontaneously without planning.

<br>

ふと空を見上げたら、きれいな風船が飛んでいた。//When I happened to look up, there was a beautiful balloon floating in the sky.

ふと頭を上げたら、そこに小さな子供が立っていた。//I just happened to look up, and there stood a small child.

<br>

### (10) ~ぶり

/// The Preparatory Stage introduced the expression ひさしぶりですねえ “We have not seen each other for quite a while, have we?”

/// The suffix ~ぶり indicates the time interval that has passed since the last event, so the element before ~ぶり should be time-related.

/// It is often used with the words that express duration.

<br>

三年ぶりに、山中さんに会った。//I saw Yamanaka-san for the first time in three years.

五日ぶりに、ご飯を食べた。//I had a meal for the first time in five days.
