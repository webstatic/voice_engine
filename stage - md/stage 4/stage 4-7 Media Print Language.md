# Stage 4-7 Media Print Language

<br>

## 1: Headlines

/// Newspapers and magazines exhibit different kinds of writing.

/// Without attempting to cover all of them, this chapter addresses only some examples of language used for reporting in media materials.

<br>

/// Headlines of newspapers, magazines, or advertisements aim for efficiency of communication.

/// They are intended for maximum communication using minimal words.

/// This is often achieved by including only the essential words. Deletion, therefore, is widely used in headlines.

<br>

/// Deletion is not random, but follows certain rules.

/// Conventional ways of deleting elements in media language will include the following:

<br>

### (1) Copula omission

/// Headlines tend to end with nominal elements.

/// For sentences with nominal predicates, the copula is deleted.

<br>

投票日は７月２９日。//Voting day is July the 29th .

先ず、運動が大切。//Above all, exercise is important.

<br>

### (2) Deletion of する

/// The nominal ending of some verbal predicates is achieved by deleting する from verbs consisting of kanji or katakana.

<br>

大統領が来日。//The President came to Japan.

首相が渡米。//The Prime Minister went to the United States.

一分で３００枚コピー。//You can copy 300 pages per minute.

<br>

### (3) Use of nominal forms

/// Other nominal forms may also be used.

/// In the following, なし is a nominal form of ない.

<br>

今年は全員、ボーナスなし。//This year it’s no bonus for anyone.

<br>

/// The stem may also be used:

<br>

初めての試み。//Their first attempt.

<br>

### (4) Deletion of an entire predicate

/// The entire predicate may be deleted when it is obvious to the reader.

/// This occurs often in headlines.

/// In some cases, particles or conjunctions may be left in the text because they suggest the deleted predicate.

<br>

首相カナダへ。//The Prime Minister leaves for Canada.

コンピュータなら、これ。//For computers, this is the best.

<br>

### (5) Particle deletion

/// When the relation between words is clear from the context, particles may be omitted.

<br>

田中、三勝目。//Tanaka’s third win.

<br>

## 2: Main Text

/// The main text of newspapers and magazines is often written in the formal style.

/// Here are some of the factors that contribute to formality in writing.

<br>

### (1) である as the copula

/// である is used as the copula in formal writing.

/// The tone of である writing is strong and assertive.

<br>

東京はアジアの窓である。//Tokyo is a window on Asia.

<br>

/// の must be inserted between adjectival and verbal predicates and である.

<br>

日本の春は桜が実に美しいのである。//Cherry blossoms are truly beautiful in spring in Japan.

夏になると、日本はとても蒸し暑くなるのである。//When the summer comes, it becomes very muggy in Japan.

<br>

/// As seen above, である may be placed immediately after a noun, but の may be added for a stronger assertion of the writer.

<br>

戦争の犠牲者は市民なのである。//Civilians are the victims in war.

<br>

#### である between nouns

/// The assertive tone explained above is absent when である is used between two nouns,

/// the first one modifying the second, which is the same function as の.

/// The use of のである is more formal than の.

<br>

/// 聖者であるマザー･テレサ Mother Teresa, the Saint

/// 日本の名門校であるXX大学 Japan’s prestigious X University

<br>

### (2) The use of 漢語

/// 漢語 {かんご} are used much more often in the media.

/// For example, in newspaper headlines, 来日 {らいにち} and 渡米 {とべい} are more likely to be seen than their equivalent phrases.

<br>

/// 日本に来る → 来日 “come to Japan”

/// 亜米利加（アメリカ）に渡る → 渡米 “go over to the United States”

<br>

### (3) Long adjectival clauses in the topic position

/// Topics of newspaper sentences often have long adjectival clauses modifying them.

<br>

/// [夫人と共に昨夜、遅く日本に到着した] 米国大統領は・・・ “The American president, who arrived in Japan late last night with his wife . . .”

<br>

/// In the above phrase, the topic 米国大統領 {べいこくだいとうりょう} “the U.S. President” is modified by everything that precedes it.
