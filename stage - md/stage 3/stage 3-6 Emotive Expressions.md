# Stage 3-6 Emotive Expressions

<br>

## 1: The Speaker’s vs. the Other’s Emotive Descriptions

### (1) Expressing emotions in Japanese

/// It has been stated previously that different structures must be used to express such things as desires and emotions of the speaker and of the third person.

<br>

/// There are common rules for all structures related to this issue; that is, describing emotions in the first person and the third person.

<br>

/// These common rules are:

/// - The structure that expresses the speaker’s emotions can also be used to ask a second person about their emotions directly.

/// - Emotions experienced by a third person can be stated by adding certain elements to the sentence structure that is used for the speaker. These will be summarized below.

<br>

#### Language of the writer and story-teller

/// The rules for emotive expressions for the first person and the third person often do not apply to stories and novels.

/// In novels, the following type of sentence is used often.

<br>

花子は嬉しかった。//Hanako was happy.

<br>

/// The topic is in the third person, but the predicate consists of an emotive adjective.

/// This is because writers and story-tellers in Japanese often use the language as if they were the speaker of the sentence, even when they use third-person pronouns or personal names.

/// It is important to distinguish such language uses from daily, real-life usage.

<br>

#### What about English?

/// English has no such restrictions on the use of emotive expressions.

/// In the following sentences, the emotive expressions used for first-person and third-person subjects are identical:

/// I am sad. He is sad. I want to go. He wants to go.

<br>

### (2) Expressing a third person’s emotions in Japanese

/// Several different structures have been introduced that may be used to express a third person’s emotive state.

/// Each of these expresses a different nuance.

/// For all examples below, consider the content of the emotive event, “the third person wants more time.”

<br>

/// First, the speaker can report by saying what the third person has told him or her:

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいと言っています。//He has been saying that he wants more time.

<br>

/// If the speaker directly observes that the third person obviously needs time, he or she can say:

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しそうです。//He looks as if he wants more time.

<br>

/// The following is similar to the sentence above.

/// The only difference is that in the sentence above, the need for time sounds urgent; in the sentence below it does not.

/// This sentence describes the speaker’s inference based on his or her direct observation, but it is expressed in more general terms:

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいようです。//He appears to want more time.

<br>

/// The next sentence reports information that the speaker has obtained from an objective source.

/// It is much like the first example, which reported what the third person said.

/// In the following sentence, the information source is not clear unless it is explicitly indicated.

### (In the sentence with 言う, of course, the information source is the third person, who has the feeling).

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいそうです。//I heard that he wants more time.

<br>

/// Sentences with らしい, like the following, are similar to the sentence with そうだ above.

/// The only slight difference is that the information source of the sentence with らしい is not totally objective.

/// The speaker acknowledges its validity.

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいらしいです。//He seems to want more time.

<br>

/// A sentence with はず indicates that the speaker expects his or her assessment of the third person’s emotion or desire to be true because there is some evidence to support it.

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいはずです。//I should think that he would want more time.

<br>

/// Of course, the speaker can also express a third person’s emotive state as his or her own opinion by using 思う.

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいと思います。//I believe that he would want more time.

<br>

/// In addition to the list above, there are still more ways to express a third person’s emotive state.

/// Some of these will be introduced below.

<br>

## 2: Adjective and Verb Pairs

/// Words that express emotions are not necessarily only adjectives.

/// There are some verbs that describe the topic’s emotions.

/// In fact, there are some adjective-verb pairs that have similar meanings, and in some cases, similar forms.

<br>

/// In terms of their uses, generally speaking, the speaker’s own desires and emotions are expressed with adjectives while those of the third person are expressed with verbs.

/// This does not mean, however, that emotive verbs are not used to describe the speaker’s emotions.

/// They are used for objective descriptions.

<br>

### (1) Examples of adjective and verb pairs

<br>

#### 嬉しい {うれしい} vs. 喜ぶ {よろこぶ}

<br>

私は試験に受かって、本当に嬉しいです。//I am very happy that I passed the test.

娘は試験に受かって、本当に喜んでいます。//My daughter is very happy that she passed the test.

<br>

/// This verb may be used to describe the speaker’s emotion objectively.

/// It is used often when the topic is plural and includes the speaker:

<br>

娘が試験に受かって、私達もとても喜んでいます。//We feel quite happy that our daughter passed the test.

<br>

#### 悲しい {かなしい} vs. 悲しむ {かなしむ}

<br>

僕はペットに死なれてしまって、本当に悲しいです。//I am very sad that my pet died.

妹はペットに死なれてしまって、本当に悲しんでいます。//My sister is very sad that her pet died.

<br>

/// The following example has a topic that includes the speaker:

<br>

妹も私もペットに死なれてしまって、本当に悲しんでいます。//Both my sister and I are very sad that our pet died.

<br>

#### 苦しい {くるしい} vs. 苦しむ {くるしむ}

<br>

私は熱が高くて、とても苦しいです。//I have a high fever, and I feel quite miserable.

彼は彼女と別れて、とても苦しんでいます。//He’s having a hard time being separated from his girlfriend.

<br>

/// The following example illustrates how a verb is used to describe a speaker’s emotion objectively.

<br>

彼と彼女が別れたことを聞いて、私もとても苦しんでいます。//I’m finding it difficult to accept their separation, too.

<br>

### (2) Topics of emotive adjectives and verbs

/// The difference between some emotive adjectives and verbs is the relation between the topic and the predicate.

/// With some emotive adjectives, the thing that the speaker has the feeling about may be the topic;

/// with emotive verbs, the person who feels must be the topic.

/// The following adjective and verb pair illustrates this difference.

<br>

#### 楽しい {たのしい} vs. 楽しむ {たのしむ}

/// In the sentence below with the adjective 楽しい, the feeling belongs to the speaker.

/// The topic is the thing about which the speaker feels something.

<br>

大学の生活は楽しいです。//For me, college life is fun.

<br>

/// With the verb 楽しむ “to enjoy,” the topic must be the person who feels:

<br>

友達は大学の生活を楽しんでいます。//My friend is enjoying life at college.

<br>

/// As explained above, with emotive verbs, the first person may be the topic,

/// but in this case, the emotive state is described rather objectively compared to verbs with emotive adjectives.

<br>

私は大学生活を楽しんでいます。//I’m enjoying life at college.

<br>

### (3) Emotive verbs to emotive nouns

/// The stems of emotive verbs can be used as emotive nouns.

<br>

/// - Meaning

/// sadness suffering happiness anger pleasure

/// - Verb

/// 悲しむ 苦しむ 喜ぶ 怒る 楽しむ

/// - Stem (Noun)

/// 悲しみ 苦しみ 喜び 怒り 楽しみ

<br>

/// The following section shows examples of some of these words.

<br>

#### Verbs

<br>

人間は喜んだり、悲しんだり、苦しんだりするとても複雑な動物です。//Human beings are complex animals that feel happiness, sadness, and suffering.

<br>

#### Stems

<br>

あの人は喜びも悲しみも苦しみも感じないのでしょうか。//Doesn’t he feel anything; happiness, sadness, or suffering?

<br>

## 3: From Adjectives to Verbs

/// Not all emotive adjectives have corresponding verbs.

/// In this case, there is a way to make an emotive adjective into an emotive verb.

/// The difference between emotive verbs and derived emotive verbs (formed by adding ~がる) is that,

/// unlike the emotive verbs explained above, the derived emotive verbs may not be used to describe the speaker’s emotions.

<br>

### (1) Suffix ~がる

/// The following rule shows how to derive emotive verbs from emotive adjectives.

/// [Drop い from the emotive adjective and add ~がる]

<br>

/// For instance, the verbal form of 欲しい is 欲しがる.

<br>

/// The following examples illustrate 欲しい for expressing desire in the first person and 欲しがる for expressing desire in the third person in two different aspects, habitual and current.

/// Notice the object marker が for the adjective and を for the verb.

<br>

私は新しい辞書が欲しいです。//I want a new dictionary.

<br>

/// ~ている in the sentence below expresses the current emotional state of the topic.

<br>

山田さんは新しい辞書を欲しがっています。//Yamada-san wants a new dictionary.

<br>

/// 欲しがる in the following sentence expresses a habitual aspect.

<br>

山田さんは私が持っている物は何でも欲しがります。//Yamada-san always wants what I have.

<br>

### (2) Even when there are pairs

/// The suffix ~がる may be used even when an adjective has a corresponding emotive verb.

<br>

#### Emotive verbs and ~がる verbs

/// The adjective 悲しい {かなしい} “sad” has a verbal counterpart, 悲しむ {かなしむ} “to become sad.”

/// This adjective may also be converted into a verb 悲しがる {かなしがる} “to be sad.”

<br>

/// What, then, is the difference between the emotive verbs and the ~がる emotive verbs?

/// As explained above, one difference is that the verb 悲しむ may be used for both the speaker’s and the third person’s emotions,

/// but the derived verb 悲しがる is used to describe only the third person’s emotions, not those of the speaker.

/// Another difference is that emotive verbs objectively describe the topic’s emotional state in rather general terms.

/// On the contrary, verbs derived from ~がる express a more immediate state based on the speaker’s direct observation.

<br>

山田さんは息子さんがアメリカに行ってしまって、悲しんでいます。//Yamada-san is sad because her son has gone to America.

山田さんは息子さんがアメリカに行ってしまって、悲しがっています。//I can tell that Yamada-san is sad because her son has gone to America.

<br>

#### ~がる verbs and stem + そう

/// Both the suffix ~がる and the complex adjectival noun with そう can be used to describe an immediate emotive state, based on the speaker’s direct observation.

<br>

/// What is the difference between these two structures?

/// The complex word with そう expresses an inference.

/// Therefore, in the first sentence below, the speaker really does not know that 山田さん is sad, although evidence suggests it.

/// The verb with ~がる indicates that the speaker actually knows that 山田さん is sad.

<br>

山田さんは息子さんがアメリカに行ってしまって、悲しそうです。//Yamada-san looks sad because her son has gone to America.

山田さんは息子さんがアメリカに行ってしまって、悲しがっています。//I know that Yamada-san is sad because her son has gone to America.

<br>

### (3) From derived adjectives to verbs

/// As previously explained, ~たい expresses the first person’s desire to do things.

/// From this derived adjective, a third person’s desire may be expressed by adding the suffix ~がる.

/// This changes the adjective to a verb:

/// たべる → たべたい → たべたがる;

/// する → したい → したがる;

/// くる → きたい → きたがる.

<br>

/// The following sentences show examples of this construction.

/// The second example illustrates the habitual aspect while the third one describes a current state.

<br>

私はアイスクリームが食べたいです。//I want to eat ice cream.

妹はいつもアイスクリームを食べたがります。//My sister always wants to eat ice cream.

妹はアイスクリームを食べたがっています。//My sister wants to eat ice cream right now.

<br>

## 4: Idiomatic Phrases with 気

/// In this section, some commonly used idiomatic phrases that include the noun 気 {き}, which literally means “mind” or “spirit,” will be introduced.

/// Some of these idiomatic phrases express emotions, and the restrictions on the use of these phrases are similar to those on the use of emotive adjectives and verbs.

/// Being able to use some idiomatic phrases adds variety and sophistication to the language level of the learner.

/// At the same time, it is a challenge to learn such phrases, as they are usually not governed by rules.

<br>

### (1) Emotive idiomatic phrases with 気 {き}

/// The following idioms are used only when the topic is the speaker.

/// When the topic is the third person, another element such as そうだ or らしい must be used (see earlier sections in this chapter for details).

<br>

<br>

### (2) Non-emotive phrases with 気

/// Even though the following idioms include 気, they all can be used to describe the speaker as well as a third person.

<br>

#### 気をつける “to pay attention”

/// The verb つける literally means “to attach something onto something else.”

/// The expression therefore means “to pay attention to [= attach the mind] to something.”

/// The phrase literally means “the mind attaches itself to something.”

/// It is used to mean “to notice something.”

<br>

彼は私が毎日、漢字を勉強していることに全然、気がつきませんね。//He never even notices that I study kanji every day.

<br>

/// This idiomatic phrase can be condensed into the single verb 気づく.

<br>

私はあの人が毎日、漢字を勉強していることに気づきました。//I noticed that he studies kanji every day.

<br>

/// When the idiom 気がつく is used to describe a person, it means “to be considerate.”

<br>

あの人はよく気がつく人です。//That person is very considerate of others’ needs.

<br>

/// For this function, the condensed verb 気づく may not be used.

<br>

#### 気にする “to be concerned”

/// This expression means that the topic is worrying or is concerned about something.

<br>

多くの若者にとって、物がないということはとても苦しいことのようだ。//It seems to me that not having material things is painful to many young people.

<br>

/// The difference between the use of に and にとって is that the latter sounds a little more emphatic in singling out the person who experiences the emotion described.

/// Both に and にとって can be used with は and も, depending on the situation.

<br>

/// When the speaker wants to focus on the contrastive sense, then, は should be used.

/// In the sentence below, 日本人 is being singled out.
