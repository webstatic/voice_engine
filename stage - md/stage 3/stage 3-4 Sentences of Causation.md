# Stage 3-4 Sentences of Causation

<br>

## 1: Causative Sentences

/// As mentioned in Stage 1–9, causative sentences, which are characterized by the use of causative verbs, express a person’s causing another person to do something.

/// The situation varies: it could be that the topic forces someone to do something, allows someone to do something, lets someone do something, or has someone do something, depending on the context.

/// In all these situations in Japanese, the topic of the causative sentence is a person with greater authority than the person mentioned in the object position.

/// When the topic has less authority than the person in the object position, a causative sentence may not be used.

/// In this case, other constructions must be used, some of which will be introduced in this chapter.

<br>

### (1) Causative verb formation

/// Group 1: Change る to させる

/// Group 2: Change the final {u} to {a} and add せる

/// Group 3: [する → させる], [くる → こさせる]

<br>

/// All derived causative verbs are Group 1 verbs.

/// The following examples show how they conjugate: たべさせる → たべさせて, かわせる → かわせて.

<br>

### (2) Verbs with no causative forms

/// There are a few groups of verbs that lack causative forms.

<br>

/// - Verbs that express non-actions or non-events lack the corresponding causative verbs.

/// For instance, some semi-transitive verbs, such as ある “to have; to exist” and 要る {いる} “to need,” do not have causative forms.

<br>

/// - The intransitive counterpart in a transitive-intransitive verb pair lacks a causative form:

/// e.g. 開く {あく}  “(something) opens” and 閉まる {しまる} “(something) closes.”

<br>

/// - Honorific verbs also lack causative forms:

/// e.g. いらっしゃる “to be”; “to go”; “to come,” くださる “to give (me),” おっしゃる “to say.”

<br>

### (3) Causative sentences

/// Causative sentences have several different meanings, as shown in the English translation of the example below.

/// In some cases, only the context can determine which meaning the sentence conveys.

/// But in all cases, the person in the topic position has more power than the person in the object place.

/// It is therefore inappropriate to use a causative sentence to express the idea of a person with less power making a person with more power do something.

<br>

先生は学生に日本語を話させます。//The teacher makes/allows/lets the student speak Japanese.

<br>

/// When expressing more than one causative action with the たり-form, the causative element may be either in the final verb する, or in a verb in the non-final position, but not in both.

/// For instance, to describe the things a teacher makes his students do in class, the following sentence uses causative elements in the non-final position.

<br>

先生は学生に漢字を書かせたり、日本語を話させたりします。//The teacher makes his students do things like write kanji and speak Japanese.

<br>

/// In the following sentence, the causative form is in the final verb する.

<br>

先生は学生に漢字を書いたり、日本語を話したりさせます。//The teacher makes his students do things like write kanji and speak Japanese.

<br>

### (4) The use of に and を with directional verbs

/// Some linguists say that different causative meanings can be identified by the use of different particles.

/// For instance, compare the following two sentences:

<br>

中村さんは子供にイギリスに行かせます。//Nakamura-san will allow his child to go to England.

<br>

中村さんは子供をイギリスに行かせます。//Nakamura-san will make his child go to England.

/// Literally, “Nakamura-san will force his child to go to England.

<br>

/// It is commonly said and believed that the use of に conveys the meaning of allowing,

/// whereas the use of を in the second sentence above would imply that the child is going despite his or her wishes to the contrary.

/// It is true that the difference between these sentences can be interpreted that way, but the difference is not as distinct as some linguists believe it to be.

/// Both of these sentences actually more or less convey the meaning of “making someone go somewhere.”

<br>

/// First of all, if this difference exists, it is a very slight one, and is true only when the verb expresses direction;

/// it does not apply to most other verbs.

/// Furthermore, regardless of the particle choice, に or を, the original meaning of the causative sentence still holds for both sentences;

/// that is, a person with power is causing a person with less power to do something.

/// Most importantly, to convey the meaning of allowing a person to do something, a more appropriate Japanese sentence would contain a giving verb in the predicate, as shown below.

<br>

中村さんは子供にイギリスに行かせてやりました。//Nakamura-san allowed his child to go to England.

<br>

### (5) The use of に and を with other verbs

/// In this section, the use of に and を with verbs other than the directional verbs will be examined.

/// See the following example with the verb 笑う {わらう}, which means “to laugh”:

<br>

あの人はいつも面白い話をして、人を笑わせます。//That person always tells funny stories, and makes people laugh.

<br>

/// In this case, the use of を indicates that the topic makes people laugh.

/// It would be unnatural to interpret the sentence as saying that the topic allows or forces another person to laugh, since the verb expresses an involuntary action.

/// For involuntary actions, を should be used for the person who is being made to do the action.

/// A similar example can be found in the following sentence, where the act of crying is an involuntary action.

<br>

あの人はいつも子供を泣かせます。//That person always makes children cry.

<br>

/// In some artificial cases, it is possible for someone to have someone else do things such as laugh or cry.

/// For instance, if a movie director wanted to have an actor laugh in a particular scene, the use of に rather than を would indicate that.

<br>

その時に、チャンさんに笑わせます。//At that time, I will make Chang-san laugh.

<br>

#### General rule for に or を for the person in the object position

/// The basic meaning conveyed by a causative sentence, regardless of the predicate used, is that the person in the topic position makes the person in the object position do something.

/// The implication is that the person in the object position carries out an action as a result.

/// The person in the object position of a causative sentence may be marked either by に or を, but these particles are not interchangeable.

<br>

/// When the verb is a transitive verb, the person who is made to act must be marked by に.

/// を may not be used here, because the direct object of the verb is marked by を.

<br>

あのうちでは、親は子供に自分のご飯を料理させます。//At that house, the parents have the children prepare their own meals.

<br>

/// For intransitive verbs, the person in the object position may be marked by に or を.

/// When を is used, it implies that the action taken by this person is an involuntary action.

/// In the following sentence, being upset is not a controllable action.

<br>

あの人はいつも私を怒らせます。//That person always makes me upset.

<br>

/// The reason some linguists believe that the use of を gives a coercive meaning may be due to this involuntary meaning conveyed by を.

/// That is, the sentence conveys the meaning of “an act not carried out deliberately” by the person mentioned in the object position.

<br>

/// When に is used, it indicates that a person deliberately carries out the action indicated by the verb:

<br>

今日は、スミスさんに泳がせるつもりだ。//I am planning to have Smith-san swim today.

<br>

### (6) て-causatives with ください

/// The て-form of a causative verb with ください indicates that the speaker is volunteering to do something.

<br>

この飲み物は私に買わせてください。//Please let me buy this drink.

<br>

/// The speaker can also use this structure to request that someone else (a third person) do something.

/// In this case, the speaker must be in an authoritative position over both the addressee and the person who is being made to do something.

<br>

掃除は妹にさせてください。でも、洗濯は兄にさせてください。//Have my younger sister do the cleaning. But have my brother do laundry.

<br>

## 2: Other Causative Forms

### (1) Short causative forms

/// There is another set of causative forms called short causative forms.

/// They are used frequently in conversation.

/// The short causative forms can be obtained by changing the causative suffix せる to す.

<br>

/// - Meaning

/// eat wait buy come do

/// - Base form

/// たべる まつ かう くる する

/// - Long causative form

/// たべさせる またせる かわせる こさせる させる

/// - Short causative form

/// たべさす またす かわす こさす さす

<br>

/// All short causative verbs are Group 2 verbs:

/// たべさす → たべさします → たべさして; かえらす → かえらします → かえらして; こさす → こさします → こさして.

<br>

/// Short causative forms are used more often in casual settings than long causative forms.

/// However, there are individual as well as regional differences in the use of long and short causative forms.

/// Compare the long and short causative verbs in the following sentences:

<br>



あの人はいつも私を待たせます。//That person always makes me wait.

/// [long causative]

<br>

あの人はいつも私を待たします。//That person always makes me wait.

/// [short causative]

<br>

### (2) Causative-like verbs

/// Some verbs have inherent causative-like meanings.

/// For instance, 起こす {おこす} means “to wake someone up”; and 着せる {きせる} “to put an outfit on someone else.”

/// These verbs are used as shown below:

<br>

母は妹を毎朝、７時に起こします。//My mother wakes my sister up at 7:00 every morning.

寒い日には、私は赤ちゃんにセーターを着せます。//On cold days, I put a sweater on the baby.

<br>

/// These verbs resemble causative verbs in that the topic causes someone to do or undergo something (e.g. my sister wakes up; the baby wears an outfit).

/// There is, however, a basic difference between the sentences above and sentences with causative verbs:

/// sentences with causative verbs indicate that the topic causes someone to actively do something.

/// Neither of the sentences above indicates such a voluntary action by the object.

<br>

/// In fact, these verbs do have causative forms, as shown below.

/// In the example sentences, the person marked by に actively carries out an action at the topic’s behest.

<br>

母は兄に妹を毎朝、７時に起こさせます。//My mother makes my brother wake up my sister at 7:00 every morning.

私は上の子供に赤ちゃんにセーターを着せさせます。//I have my older child put a sweater on the baby.

<br>

## 3: Other Constructions of Causation

/// The use of causative verbs is not the only way to indicate that someone causes someone else to do something.

<br>

### (1) ~て欲（ほ）しい

/// Recall that the stem with ~たい is a structure expressing the speaker’s desire to do something.

<br>

私はもっと勉強したいです。//I want to study more.

<br>

/// This structure may not be used when the speaker wants other people do something.

/// For this purpose, the て-form of the verb and the adjective 欲しい {ほしい} is used.

<br>

#### Positive

/// The following sentences demonstrate the use of the positive predicate:

<br>

私はあなたにもっと勉強して欲しいです。//I want you to study more.

あの会議では私は森さんに話して欲しいと思っています。//I want Mori-san to speak at that meeting.

<br>

/// Since 欲しい, an emotive adjective, is a part of this structure, this construction may be used only when the speaker is expressing his or her own wish or when the speaker is asking the addressee a question directly.

/// Like other emotive words, this structure may not be used to describe a third person’s wish unless another element is added in the predicate.

/// Many such elements may be added; they all convey different nuances. The following is one such example:

<br>

田中先生は学生にもっと勉強して欲しいようです。//It seems that Tanaka-sensei wants his students to study more.

<br>

#### Negative

/// There are two ways to negate the ~て欲しい construction.

<br>

あの会議では私は森さんに話して欲しくないと思っています。//I don’t want Mori-san to speak at that meeting.

あの会議では私は森さんに話さないで欲しいと思っています。//I don’t want Mori-san to say anything at that meeting.

<br>

/// The difference in meaning between the two is subtle:

/// the first sentence is based on the possibility that Mori-san might say something,

/// but the second sentence does not necessarily assume it.

<br>

#### Causative-て + 欲しい

/// Compare the following three sentences:

<br>

私に行かせてください。//Please let me go.

私に行かせて欲しいです。//I want you to let me go.

中村さんに行かせて欲しいです。//I want you to let Nakamura-san go.

<br>

/// The first sentence is a direct request, while the latter two express requests by using statement sentences.

<br>

### (2) Causatives and ~てもらう（~ていただく）

/// As has been pointed out more than once, only a person with greater authority can be the topic of a causative sentence.

/// For instance, in a case where a mother makes her child do something, the use of a causative sentence is appropriate.

<br>

うちの子に先生に手紙を書かせました。//I made my child write a letter to her teacher.

<br>

/// The following explanation and example sentences deal with a different power dynamic than the one in the situation above.

/// Suppose the speaker needs to ask someone with an equal level of authority to do something on her or his behalf.

/// In this case, it would not be appropriate to use a causative.

/// Instead, the use of ~てもらう (or ~ていただく, depending on whom the speaker asks) is more appropriate.

/// The sentence implies that the topic asked the person in the object position to do something and received the favor as a result of asking.

<br>

私はルームメートに手紙を書いてもらいました。//I had my roommate write a letter for me.

<br>

/// The following sentence is an example of a speaker making a request to someone who is in a position of greater authority than the speaker.

<br>

先生にこれを説明していただきました。//I asked the teacher to explain this to me.

<br>

/// When the speaker wants to volunteer something but needs to ask someone else,

/// then a combination of a causative verb and the verb もらう or いただく is necessary.

<br>

翻訳は私にさせてもらいました。//I requested that I be allowed to do the translation.

<br>

/// The difference between ~てもらう（いただく） and ~てくれる（くださる） may be reviewed in Stage 2–4.

<br>

## 4: Causative-Passive Verbs and Sentences

### (1) Causative-passive verb forms

/// Causative verbs may be changed into passive forms.

/// Since all causative verbs are Group 1 verbs, there is only one rule.

/// [る of causative verbs → られる]

<br>

/// The reverse does not work; that is, passive verbs cannot be changed into causative verbs.

<br>

/// - Base form

/// たべる いく かう する くる

/// - Causative form

/// たべさせる いかせる かわせる させる こさせる

/// - Causative-passive form

/// たべさせられる いかせられる かわせられる させられる こさせられる

<br>

子供の時、私は両親にミルクをたくさん飲ませられました。//When I was a child, I was made to drink a lot of milk by my parents.

日本語の授業では、いつも宿題をたくさんさせられます。//We are always made to do a lot of homework for our Japanese class.

<br>

### (2) Short causative-passive verb forms

/// Just as causatives have the short causative form, there is also a corresponding passive form called the short causative-passive form.

<br>

/// As mentioned earlier, all short causatives are Group 2 verbs that end with す.

/// The rule for changing this into the passive is therefore as follows:

/// [Change the final vowel u to a and add れる]

<br>

/// Examples of short causative-passives

/// - Base form

/// いく まつ かう

/// - Long causative

/// いかせる またせる かわせる

/// - Short causative

/// いかす またす かわす

/// - Short causative-passive

/// いかされる またされる かわされる

<br>

彼と待ち合わせをする時は、いつも待たされます。//I am always made to wait for him when I meet with him.

あの店に行くと、いつも要らない物をたくさん買わされます。//Whenever I go to that store, I am always made to buy many unnecessary things.

<br>

#### Awkward short causative-passive forms

/// The short causative-passives are used most often with the original (i.e. not derived) Group 2 verbs.

/// The original Group 1 and 3 verbs result in the syllable repetition of ささ, which makes the forms awkward.

/// The only verbs among the original Group 2 verbs that produce such an awkward form are those that end with ~す, like 話す.

/// The following illustrates some awkward short causative-passive forms.

/// They are awkward, but some may be used colloquially.

<br>

/// - Base form

/// たべる する くる はなす

/// - Long causative

/// たべさせる させる こさせる はなさせる

/// - Short causative

/// たべさす さす こさす はなさす

/// - Short causative-passive

/// たべさされる さされる こさされる はなさされる
