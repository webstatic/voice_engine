# Stage 2-1 Conjunctive Forms and Their Uses

## 1: The Continuous Aspect

### (1) Conjunctive forms

/// the rules for the conjunctive forms are exactly the same as those for the plain positive perfective forms except for the final syllable.

/// Instead of ending the form with た or だ, as in the plain positive perfectives, the conjunctive forms end in て or で.

<br>

### (2) The continuous aspect of repeatable (punctual) verbs

/// The て-form and the verb いる together express the continuous aspect of an action, event, or state.

/// whether the continuous meaning is one of action or state depends on the type of verb.

<br>

/// Verbs such as “to eat” and “to study” denote actions that one can repeat or do continuously.

/// For these verbs, the construction with ~て and いる indicates repeated actions.

/// This construction therefore has two different meanings, as indicated below:

<br>

日本語を勉強しています。//I am currently studying Japanese.

/// or “I have been studying Japanese for some time.”

<br>

#### The continuous aspect of non-action verbs

/// Some stative verbs, such as some semi-transitive verbs, do not use the ~ている construction.

/// These verbs are stative in meaning, and thus are already continuous in nature.

<br>

私はいい辞書がいります。//I need a good dictionary.

私は日本語が話せます。//I am able to speak Japanese.

<br>

/// ~ている may not be used to express ideas above, as shown in the following incorrect sentences:

<br>

#### When a verb has more than one meaning

/// A single word often has multiple meanings. One such example is the verb 分かる {わかる}.

/// The following sentence indicates that the topic has a specific ability; the verb therefore has a stative meaning.

<br>

私は日本語が分かります。//I understand Japanese.

/// [ = I have the ability to understand Japanese.]

<br>

/// The idea in the sentence above cannot be expressed with ~ている, because having the ability to do something refers to a state or condition, rather than an action or an event.

<br>

/// The verb 分かる has a second meaning, however: “to figure something out.”

/// This verb may also be used to talk about having obtained knowledge about a specific thing or person.

/// This meaning indicates a process, rather than a state. When the verb carries this meaning, the ~ている construction can be used.

<br>

あの人のことはよく分かっています。//I have heard a lot about that person, and I now have a good understanding of him.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) The continuous aspect of non-repeatable (punctual) verbs

/// Verbs such as the second meaning of 分かる {わかる} “to figure something out” and 起きる {おきる} “to get up” denote a one-time, non-repeatable action.

/// This type of verb is sometimes termed a “punctual verb.”

/// The て-form of these verbs, when used with いる, indicates that the action has been completed, and the topic is currently in the state of maintaining the completed action.

<br>

起きています。//I am up.

<br>

/// The sentence above does not refer to the process of getting up, but rather the state of being awake after the action of getting up has been completed.

/// With a punctual verb such as 起きる, Japanese speakers normally use either the positive imperfective to say “I will get up soon,” or use ~ている to say “I am up already.”

/// They will seldom utter a sentence that is equivalent to “I am in the process of getting up.”

<br>

#### The verb 知る {しる}

/// The verb 知る, often translated as “to know,” and the verb 分かる, translated as “to understand,” are similar in meaning.

/// 知る implies obtaining information, while 分かる implies having an ability to figure things out, and also refers to the process of figuring things out.

<br>

/// The ~ている construction with the verb 知る is used to talk about the possession of knowledge.

<br>

私はあの人の名前を知っています。//I know that person’s name.

<br>

/// the ~ている construction cannot be used as the negative of 知っている {しっている}

/// To say that a person does not possess knowledge of something, the imperfective negative is used, rather than the negative of the ~ている construction:

<br>

私はあの人の名前を知りません。//I don’t know that person’s name.

<br>

/// When asking whether a person possesses a certain piece of information, the negative 知りませんか {しりませんか} is used as often as the positive 知っていますか {しっていますか}.

<br>

あの人の電話番号を知りませんか。//Do you know that person’s phone number?

あの人の電話番号を知っていますか。//Do you know that person’s phone number?

<br>

#### 持つ {もつ} vs. ある

/// Both 持つ and ある are normally translated into English as the verb “to have.”

/// One significant difference between the two is that 持つ implies that the topic is physically holding something; ある does not include this implication.

/// For instance, if someone is carrying a bag, the verb 持つ must be used, rather than ある:

<br>

あの人は何を持っていますか。//What does that person have?

鞄を持っています。//He has a bag.

<br>

/// To talk about possession of an abstract item at a specific time, ある is normally used.

<br>

今日、僕は時間がたくさんあります。//I have a lot of time today.

<br>

/// When talking about possessing abstract things such as 考え {かんがえ} “thoughts” or “ideas” at a non-specific time, 持つ may also be used:

<br>

あの人はいい考えをたくさん持っています。//He has a lot of good ideas.

<br>

/// Both ある and 持つ may be used to talk about possession of things, concepts, or ideas rather than physically carrying something:

<br>

時雨さんはお金をたくさん持っています。//Shigure-san has possesses a lot of money.

時雨さんはお金がたくさんあります。//Shigure-san has a lot of money.

時雨さんの家はお金がたくさんあります。//The Shigure estate has a lot of money.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) The continuous aspect of directional verbs

/// The following sentence contains a directional verb in the ~ている aspect.

<br>

パクさんは日本に行っています。//Park-san has gone to Japan.

<br>

/// It means that the act of going to Japan has been completed

<br>

加藤さんはここに来ています。//Kato-san has arrived.

父は家に帰っています。//My father has come home.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Joining Predicates

### (1) Joining two predicates

/// the conjunctive form is used to join clauses.

<br>

#### Non-action (stative) predicates

<br>

私はクリスで、日本語の学生です。//I’m Kurisu, a student of Japanese.

中国は大きくて、遠いです。//China is both large and far away.

あの人は英語も話せて、漢字も読めます。//That person can speak English, and can read kanji too.

<br>

#### Action verbs

/// the order of actions is implied.

/// the first action mentioned is understood as being completed before the action mentioned next begins.

/// the aspect of the final verb determines the aspect of all the actions in the sentence.

/// This is because the conjunctive form lacks aspectual forms.

<br>

私は勉強して、運動します。//I will study and then exercise.

私は勉強して、運動しました。//I studied and then exercised.

<br>

/// When two clauses have different topics, however, the order of actions is not implicit, as it would be with a single topic:

<br>

昨日、僕は勉強して、時雨さんは運動しました。//I studied, but Shigure-san exercised yesterday.

<br>

#### Color terms and how to join them

/// most primary colors have both adjectival and nominal forms.

/// For example, 赤 {あか}, a noun, and 赤い {あかい}, an adjective, are both words for “red.”

/// Similarly, the adjectives 黒い {くろい} “black,” 青い {あおい} “blue,” and 白い {しろい} “white” have the nominal forms 黒 {くろ}, 青 {あお}, and 白 {しろ} respectively.

<br>

/// When a nominal color term modifies a noun, the particle の must be used between the two nouns, with the color term being the first element.

/// の is required because the color terms are nouns rather than adjectives.

/// 赤のかばん  黒のペン

<br>

/// Some color terms, such as 緑 {みどり} and 緑色 {みどりいろ}, which both mean “green,” do not have the adjectival options. These words are nouns.

<br>

/// Japanese color terms sometimes differ from those in English regarding the range of color that each term refers to on the color spectrum.

/// For instance, the green of a traffic light in Japan is referred to as 青 {あお} “blue,” even though it is a greenish color. This is because the term 青 {あお} covers a wider range of colors than the English term “blue.”

<br>

/// When two descriptive predicates are applied to a single topic, it is understood that each of the predicates describes the topic completely.

<br>

この本は小さくて、高いです。//This is a small, expensive book.

<br>

/// When using more than one color term to describe an item, the nominal forms of the color terms with the conjunction と must be used.

<br>

私の鞄は赤と黒です。//My bag is black and red.

<br>

/// When two different color terms are used to describe two different topics in a single sentence, however, the conjunctive construction may be used.

/// Each color describes only one topic.

<br>

あの鞄は赤くて、この鞄は黒いです。//That bag is red, and this bag is black.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) When the first nominal or adjectival predicate is negative

/// Since all negative plain forms end with ~い (from ~ない), all negatives are conjugated according to the rules for adjectives.

/// The following examples use the conjunctive forms of negative nominal and adjectival predicates to join other predicates:

<br>

私は日本人じゃなくて、中国人です。//I’m not Japanese, I’m Chinese.

この寿司は美味しくなくて、高いです。//This sushi doesn’t taste good, but it’s expensive.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) When the first verbal predicate is negative

/// -> ["~ないで, ..."]

/// When the initial predicate is a negative verbal predicate, it is joined differently to the predicate that follows.

/// The meaning of the sentence is also different.

/// In this case, the combination of the plain negative imperfective of a verb and the conjunctive of the copula で is used to join the negative verbal predicate to a second predicate.

<br>

/// The meaning of the sentence is that the action described in the second predicate is, or will be, begun without completing the action described in the first predicate.

<br>

朝ご飯を食べないで、学校に行きました。//I went to school without eating breakfast first.

勉強しないで、試験を受けました。//I took an exam without studying first.

<br>

/// When the conjunctive form of a negative imperfective verb is used, the clause takes on a causal meaning.

/// The independent clause indicates naturally occurring consequences such as 困る {こまる} “feel troubled; feel worried,” as seen below:

<br>

この宿題が分からないて、困っています。//I’m worried because I don’t understand this assignment.

<br>

/// two or more different types of predicates (e.g. nominal and adjectival predicates) may be joined by the conjunctive form to make a single sentence.

/// However, in this case, action and non-action predicates may not be joined by the conjunctive form to make a single sentence, unless the sentence expresses a cause-consequence relation.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Joining predicates with ~てから

#### The sentential conjunction それから

/// adds the meaning of “from that point on,” or “after completing that action.”

<br>

私は朝ご飯を食べました。それから、走りました。//I ate breakfast. After that, I went running.

<br>

/// The two separate sentences above can be joined by putting the first predicate into the て-form followed by から (from それから).

/// This does not change the meaning.

<br>

私は朝ご飯を食べてから、走りました。//After eating breakfast, I went running.

<br>

/// ~てから may not be used for a non-action predicate, because ~てから expresses the completion of an action.

/// Non-action predicates have nothing to “complete.” Such an idea is impossible in English as well as in Japanese:

<br>

#### The difference between the use of ~て only and ~てから

<br>

私は図書館に行って、本を読みました。//I went to the library, where I read a book.

私は図書館に行ってから、本を読みました。//After visiting the library, I read a book.

<br>

/// The only structural difference between the two sentences above is the use of から after the conjunctive form 行って {いって}.

/// The first sentence means that the topic went to the library; there in the library the next action—reading a book—took place.

<br>

/// The second sentence, however, indicates that the visit to the library was completed at the time of speaking.

/// The next action, reading a book, is expressed as a separate action.

/// The sentence does not indicate that reading the book took place in the library (it could be either at the library or somewhere else).

<br>

/// When the two clauses have different topics, the topic of the clause with ~てから must be marked by が; the topic of the main clause must be marked by は.

<br>

加藤さんが勉強してから、私達は映画に行きました。//After Kato-san finished studying, we went to the movie.

<br>

/// If the speaker wants to say that going to the movie took place only after Kato-san had finished studying, this cannot be expressed by simply joining the predicate with the て-form alone.

/// In this case, から must follow the て-form between the two clauses.

<br>

/// Compare also the Japanese sentence above with its English translation, in which the order of the dependent and independent clauses is not fixed.

/// In Japanese, the dependent clause (which is the adverbial clause in the above case) must be expressed first, followed by the independent (main) clause.

/// The clauses are never reversed except in casual conversation (with a specific meaning).

<br>

/// Learners of Japanese often confuse sentences using the causal conjunction から with those using ~ てから, which indicates the completion of an action.

/// The two have rather different meanings, however.

<br>

コーヒーを飲んだから、家を出ました。//Because I had drunk my coffee, I left the house.

コーヒーを飲んでから、家を出ました。//After I had drunk my coffee, I left the house.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Polite Commands and Requests

/// -> ["the conjunctive form of a verb" + 下さい]

### (1) Positive commands and requests

/// Teachers of Japanese often use the conjunctive form of a verb and ください (the kanji 下さい may be used for ください) to instruct their students to do certain activities in class.

/// This construction is used to indicate a polite command.

/// The same structure may also be used for a polite request, depending on the situation.

/// The difference between a command and a request is not cut-and-dried; it is based more on social context rather than any clear linguistic differentiation.

<br>

/// The following sentence might be a command if it were used by an instructor; used by a store clerk, it could be a request.

<br>

ここに名前を書いて下さい。//Write your name here.

<br>

/// Regardless of any ambiguity, when ませんか is added to this construction, the request or command becomes more polite.

<br>

日本語を話して下さい。//Please speak Japanese.

日本語を話して下さいませんか。//May I ask you to speak Japanese?

<br>

/// The polite command is normally used in a formal setting, as when a teacher is addressing his or her students, or a customer is speaking to a taxi driver.

/// This construction is too polite to be used by a parent to address his or her children.

<br>

/// Polite requests may be used by a student to a teacher, by a store clerk to a customer, or when speaking to a stranger, for example.

/// There are many levels of politeness in Japanese

<br>

### (2) Negative commands and requests

/// -> ["the plain negative imperfective form" + で + ください  (+ ませんか)]

/// The structure of the polite negative command or request is constructed with the plain negative imperfective form and the conjunctive form of the copula で, with ください added for a command and a request.

/// くださいませんか is added for politeness with commands and requests.

/// The conjunctive form of the negative imperfective form, ~なくて, should not be used to make a negative command or request.

<br>

日本語を話さないで下さい。//Please do not speak Japanese.

日本語を話さないで下さいませんか。//Would you please not speak Japanese?

<br>

#### Deadline particle までに

/// The particle までに expresses the time required to complete an action.

/// Do not confuse it with the particle まで, which indicates an ending point.

<br>

明日、ここに五時までに来て下さい。//Please come here by 5:00 tomorrow.

今日、ここに五時までいます。//I will stay here until 5:00 today.

<br>

### (3) ください（ませんか） with no preceding verbs

/// ください（ませんか） can be used on its own without a verb to request something.

<br>

ペンを下さい。//Please give me a pen.

ペンを下さいませんか。//Would you please give me a pen?

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Other Functions of the て-form

### (1) Means

/// the て-form of the verb in the first predicate can join the verb in the second predicate 

/// to indicate that the actions in the two clauses take place in the same order as the verbs are mentioned.

<br>

朝、起きて、走りました。//In the morning I got up, and then I went running.

<br>

/// the conjunctive form of a certain verb may be used to express means

<br>

私は歩いて、学校に行きます。//I go to school on foot.

<br>

/// The above sentence, however, cannot be construed to say “I walked first, and then I went to school.”

/// Rather, the two actions—walking and going to school—take place simultaneously; the first verb expresses the means of going.

<br>

### (2) Permission ~てもいい

/// The conjunctive form followed by the particle も and the adjective いい expresses “permission” to do something.

<br>

これを食べてもいいですか。//May I eat this?

ええ、いいですよ。どうぞ、食べてください。//Yes, you may. Please, go ahead and eat it.

<br>

/// どうぞ is used to strongly encourage the addressee to do something.

<br>

/// When the speaker wants to deny the request, the following construction may be used:

<br>

いいえ。ぞれは食べないでください。//No. Please don’t eat that.

<br>

### (3) Prohibition ~てはいけない

/// The conjunctive form of a verb with the particle は and いけない together indicates that something is prohibited.

<br>

これを食べてもいいですか。//May I eat this?

いいえ。それは食べてはいけません。//No. You mustn’t eat that.

<br>

### (4) ~てみる

/// The verb 見る has a few different meanings such as “to see,” “to look,” or “to watch.”

/// When this verb is combined with other verbs in the conjunctive form, its meaning becomes somewhat more abstract, expressing something like “examine the result of [the action expressed by the preceding verb].”

/// みる is not normally written in kanji in such a construction.

<br>

寿司を食べてみました。//I tried eating sushi.

<br>

/// The final verb みる is changed to express aspect:

<br>

寿司を食べてみます。//I will try eating sushi.

寿司を食べてみてください。//Try eating some sushi.

<br>

/// The construction ~てみる is frequently translated with the verb “try” in English.

/// The English word “try,” however, has different meanings, not all of which can be conveyed by ~てみる.

/// For instance, the verb “try” has a connotation of “making an effort.” So, if the speaker is asked to come home early tonight, he or she might say, “I will try to come home early.” In this case, the verb “try” does not convey the same meaning as it does in “I tried eating sushi.”

/// ~てみる only focuses on examining the result of doing or having done the action expressed by the conjunctive form of the first verb.

<br>

### (5) ~てしまう

/// The verb しまう means “to put things away.”

/// It is used as a regular verb, as in the following:

<br>

母からの手紙を机の中にしまいました。//I put the letters from my mother away inside the desk.

<br>

#### Intentional acts

/// When combined with the て-form of a verb, especially when the verb indicates something that the topic has control over,

/// the use of しまう in the predicate signifies the completion of an event.

<br>

そのケーキを食べてしまって下さい。//Please finish eating that cake.

ルームメートはもう宿題をしてしまいました。//My roommate has already finished doing her homework.

<br>

#### Unintentional events or unexpected results

/// When the first verb indicates an uncontrollable event, 

/// then the event expressed by the predicate with しまう is an unintended, or unexpected, result.

<br>

バスの中で寝てしまいました。//I accidentally fell asleep on the bus.

今学期、日本語を勉強しなかったら、全部、漢字を忘れてしまいました。//I didn’t study Japanese this semester, and I completely forgot all the kanji.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Adverbs もう and まだ

### (1) Overall meanings

/// もう and まだ have the following meanings depending on the aspect of the predicate:

/// - Positive predicate:

///     もう -> already (done),

///     まだ -> still (doing)

/// - Negative predicate:

///     もう -> no longer (doing),

///     まだ -> not yet (done)

<br>

もうあの映画を見ました。//I have already seen the movie.

もうあの映画を見ていません。//I am no longer watching the movie.

まだあの映画を見ています。//I am still watching the movie.

まだあの映画をみていません。//I have not seen that movie yet.

<br>

### (2) て-form with いない

/// ~ていない is used to respond negatively to a question such as the following:

<br>

朝ご飯をもう食べましたか。//Have you eaten breakfast already?

<br>

/// If the speaker has eaten, the predicate is simply repeated:

<br>

ええ、もう食べました。//Yes, I ate already.

<br>

/// When the speaker has not eaten, then ~ていない must be used with the adverb まだ.

<br>

いいえ、まだ食べていません。//No, I haven’t eaten yet.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Using the polite form in speech

<br>

何、読んでますか。//What are you reading?

日本語の小説です。//A Japanese novel.

<br>

/// ~ている is often shortened in casual speech by deleting the い, so that it becomes ~てる.

/// The polite form can also follow this pattern: one may say ~てます rather than ~ています when speaking.

/// Deleting this い gives a more casual sense in both cases.

<br>

今、食べている。//I’m eating now.

今、食べてる。//I’m eating now.

今、たべています。//I’m eating now.

今、食べてます。//I’m eating now.

<br>

### (2) Good wishes

<br>

その本、難しくありませんか。//Isn’t that book difficult?

難しいですが、来週、試験があるんです。//It is, but we have an exam next week.

試験ですか。大変ですね。頑張ってくださいね。//Really? Sounds tough. Good luck.

<br>

#### 大変ですね

/// 大変 {たいへん}, an adjectival noun, can mean many things. It may mean “difficult; hard; laborious; dreadful; awful; immense” and so on.

/// When used to describe a person, it may convey something like “difficult to deal with; unreasonable; unreal; awful” and similar ideas.

/// 大変ですね is often used as a backchannel to express some kind of sympathy or empathy.

<br>

#### 頑張ってください {がんばってください}

/// Japanese speakers use this phrase a great deal in conversation.

/// It is used to convey good wishes, or wishes for a good result, with reference to a current or upcoming situation or endeavor which may be difficult for the addressee.

/// In casual conversation, ください is deleted; 頑張って {かんばって} alone is used.

<br>

### (3) 先輩 {せんぱい} and 後輩 {こうはい}

<br>

ああ、お腹、すいた！//Wow, I’m hungry!

先輩、まだ、食べてないんですか。//Haven’t you eaten yet, Senpai?

うん、まだ。これ、食べていい？//Not yet. Can I have this?

どうぞ、どうぞ。//Oh sure, help yourself.

でも、これ、マイクさんのじゃないの？//But doesn’t it belong to Mike?

大丈夫ですよ。心配しないでください。さあ、食べてください。//It’s all right. Don’t worry. Please go ahead and eat it.

<br>

#### 先輩 {せんぱい}・後輩 {こうはい}

/// 先輩 refers to an individual who is senior to the speaker within a group, such as an extracurricular group, a club, or any other organized group. It may also simply refer to the speaker’s mentor.

/// 後輩 is the junior in relation to 先輩.

/// Instead of using the person’s name, the junior speaker may address the senior person as 先輩.

/// Note, however, that the term 後輩 may not be used to address another person.

<br>

#### 食べていい？

/// も may be deleted in casual speech, as in the above sentence.

/// 食べていい？ is therefore a casual way to say 食べてもいいですか.

<br>

#### どうぞ、どうぞ

/// As explained earlier in this chapter, どうぞ is used to emphatically invite an addressee to do something (to eat, in the example above).

/// Repeating the word makes it stronger.

<br>

#### の in question sentences

/// When the sentence-final particle の is used in question sentences in casual conversation, it functions the same as んですか;

/// that is, the speaker is confirming his or her understanding with the addressee.

<br>

#### 心配 {しんぱい}しないでください

/// 心配 is a noun that means “anxiety” or “worry.”

/// 心配しないでください is used to comfort the addressee.

/// The phrase means something like “There is no need for you to worry”; or “Don’t worry.”

/// In casual conversation, ください is deleted: 心配しないで.

<br>

### (4) Giving a taxi driver directions

<br>

「森ビル」までお腹いします。//Take me to the Mori Building, please.

銀行の角を曲がってください。そして、そこをまっすぐ行ってください。//Please turn at the corner by the bank. And then go straight.

あそこを右に曲がってください。あっ、あの建物の左に止まってください。//Please turn right there. Oh, please stop to the left of that building.

/// 角(かど) corner

/// まっすぐ straight

/// 曲がる(まがる) turn

/// 止まる(とまる) stopstage ２，２。

# Stage 2-2 Adjectival Clauses

## 1: Predicates in the Non-Final Position

### (1) Plain forms in the final and non-final positions

/// plain forms have a number of different functions.

/// When they are used in the final position of a sentence in speech, it indicates that the relationship between speaker and addressee is close (close friends, family members, classmates, etc.);

/// when used in writing, it indicates that it is impersonal writing (the writer is not addressing any particular individual).

<br>

/// When a predicate is used in a non-final position in a sentence, the plain predicate is used regardless of the speech (or written) style.

<br>

### (2) Compound vs. complex sentences

/// As complex sentences and compound sentences are often confused. Understanding the difference between complex sentences and compound sentences is important when forming and using plain and polite predicates.

<br>

#### Compound sentences

/// A compound sentence consists of two or more independent clauses that are joined by a conjunction.

/// an independent clause is one that can be used alone as a sentence without being preceded or followed by another clause.

/// the conjunction が may be used between two independent clauses.

<br>

/// The order of clauses in a compound sentence can be reversed without affecting meaning.

/// The order may be important for other reasons, such as politeness, or order of importance, but the logical meaning is not changed by reversing their order; this is because neither clause modifies the other.

<br>

チャンさんは中国人ですが、私は日本人です。//Chang-san is Chinese, and I’m Japanese.

私は日本人ですが、チャンさんは中国人です。//I’m Japanese, and Chang-san is Chinese.

<br>

/// The two clauses joined by が must have the same predicate form; that is, they must either be all polite or all plain. They cannot be mixed.

<br>

私は日本人だが、チャンさんは中国人だ。//I’m Japanese, and Chang-san is Chinese.

<br>

#### Complex sentences

/// A complex sentence consists of at least one dependent clause and one independent clause.

/// the function of a dependent clause is the same as that of an adjective or adverb, but on the level of a clause rather than a word.

/// These dependent clauses are therefore called adverbial and adjectival clauses.

/// Because they function adjectivally and adverbially, they must be used before the independent clauses;

/// Unlike Compound sentences, the order cannot be reversed.

<br>

### (3) The concept of adjectival clauses

/// These clauses are handled differently in English and Japanese.

/// The first difference is that in English, the adverbial clause is placed after the noun it modifies; in Japanese it is placed before the noun.

/// The second difference is that the pronouns “that” and “who” used in the adjectival clauses in the English sentences do not exist in Japanese.

<br>

私は昨日、買った本を読みました。//I read the book that I bought yesterday.

先生と話している男の人は私のルームメートです。//The man who is speaking with the teacher is my roommate.

<br>

/// To summarize, the following points are relevant to sentences with adjectival clauses:

/// - The adjectival clause must be placed before the noun it modifies;

/// - The predicate within the adjectival clause is in the plain form;

/// - If the two topics is the different, The topic in the adjectival clause must be marked by が, the topic in the independent clause must be marked by は.

/// If the two topics are the same, the topic in the adjectival clause is normally deleted; there is no need to mark each one with が and は.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Modified Nouns

### (1) Modifying regular nouns

#### A noun modifying a noun

/// -> [N1 の N0] => N0 of N1

/// the particle の must be used between the two nouns.

/// In this case, the preceding noun modifies the following one:

/// 先生の本     東京の大学

<br>

#### An adjectival noun modifying a noun

/// -> [adj-N な N]

/// When an adjectival noun modifies a noun, the particle な must be placed immediately before the noun it modifies.

<br>

あの人は嫌な人です。//That person is a nasty person.

<br>

#### An adjective modifying a noun

/// -> [adj N]

/// When an adjective modifies a noun, it is placed immediately before the noun it modifies and no particle is used between them.

<br>

これはいい本です。//This is a good book.

<br>

#### A clause modifying a noun (adjectival clause)

<br>

私は昨日、買った本を読みました。//I read the book that I bought yesterday.

私は昨日、クリスさんが買った本を読みました。//I read the book that Kurisu-san bought yesterday.

<br>

/// any of the three predicate types (nominal, adjectival, or verbal) can be used in the adjectival clause.

/// When a nominal predicate in an adjectival clause contains a noun, の must be used between the two nouns.

/// When a nominal predicate in an adjectival clause contains an adjectival noun, な must be used between the adjectival noun and the noun.

/// When an adjectival predicate and a verbal predicate are used in an adjectival clause, no element is necessary between the adjective or the verb and the noun it modifies.

<br>

私は出身が日本の学生と友達になりました。//I made friends with a student from Japan.

私は目がとてもきれいな人と話しました。//I talked to a person with pretty eyes.

私は先生がとてもいい大学に行っています。//I go to a college that has good teachers.

<br>

私は昨日クリスさんの買った本を読みました。//I read the book that Kurisu-san bought yesterday.

<br>

#### The use of の in adjectival clauses

/// One additional fact about adjectival clauses is that the topic, subject, and object marker が in the adjectival clause may be replaced by の in most predicates.

<br>

/// The following sentence indicates the use of の for the topic position in the adjectival clause:

<br>

私は昨日ジョンさんの買った本を読みました。//I read the book that John bought yesterday.

<br>

/// The following sentences indicate the use of の for the subject position in the adjectival clause:

<br>

私は目のとてもきれいな人と話しました。//I talked to a person with pretty eyes.

私は先生のとてもいい大学に行っています。//I go to a college with good teachers.

<br>

/// The following sentence indicates the use of の in the object position in the adjectival clause:

<br>

私は日本語の上手な学生と話しました。//I talked with a student who is good at Japanese.

<br>

/// In some isolated cases, の may replace the object marker を, especially when the object is topicalized, as shown below:

<br>

昨日、名前の知らない学生と話しました。//Yesterday I spoke to a student whose name is unknown to me.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) こと as a regular and functional noun

/// こと can be used as a regular noun or a functional noun.

/// As a regular noun, it refers to abstract things,

/// while もの is used to refer to concrete things or concepts (“ideas,” “music,” “habits,” and so on are examples of concepts).

/// When もの refers to concepts, it is not normally written in kanji (物).

<br>

面白いことを聞きました。//I heard an interesting thing.

面白い物を買いました。//I bought an interesting thing.

面白いものを習っています。//I am learning an interesting thing.

<br>

/// こと is here called a functional noun because it is not used as a noun with a referent, but rather gives the preceding verb a nominal function.

<br>

私は本を読むことが好きです。//I like to read books.

<br>

### (3) の as a pronoun

/// の, on the other hand, is a pronoun, as shown below. の is used in the second sentence to refer to the noun 本.

<br>

彼は面白い本を買いました。でも、僕はつまらないの買いました。//He bought an interesting book, but I bought a boring one.

<br>

/// の is also used to nominalize the preceding verb, just as こと is.

<br>

私は本を読むのが好きです。//I like to read books.

<br>

### (4) こと and の as nominalizers

/// こと and の as nominalizers are interchangeable in many cases.

<br>

/// The following pair of sentences illustrates that both こと and の may be used to nominalize verbs in the topic position.

<br>

日本語を話すことは難しいです。//Speaking Japanese is difficult.

日本語を話すのは難しいです。//Speaking Japanese is difficult.

<br>

/// The following sentence pair shows cases in which こと and の are used to nominalize verbs in the object position.

<br>

私は寿司を食べることが好きです。//I like to eat sushi.

私は寿司を食べるのが好きです。//I like to eat sushi.

<br>

/// Although こと and の can often be used identically, there are cases in which they are not interchangeable, such as in fixed expressions, and other differences

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Fixed Expressions

/// In all of the following fixed expressions, the functional nouns such as こと and ほう are modified by adjectival clauses.

<br>

### (1) ことができる

/// When a nominalized verb is in the object position with the verb できる, only こと rather than の may be used as a nominalizer.

/// The fixed expression with ことができる indicates the ability or possibility of the topic in the same way as the potential verb does.

<br>

僕は日本語ができます。//I have some Japanese ability.

<br>

/// The potential form is used more often in conversation than the expression with ことができる.

/// The fixed expression is more formal.

<br>

僕は日本語を話すことができます。//I can speak Japanese.

この店で日本語を話すことが出来ます。//It’s possible to speak Japanese at this store.

<br>

僕は日本語が話せます。//I can speak Japanese.

この店で日本語が話せます。//It is possible to speak Japanese at this store.

<br>

### (2) [Perfective verb] ことがある

/// This fixed expression is used to talk about past experiences. In this structure, the perfective form must be used before ことがある.

<br>

私は日本に行ったことがあります。//I have been to Japan.

<br>

/// The noun こと in this construction means something like “occasion” or “experience.”

/// The sentence above therefore literally means that “I have the experience of having gone to Japan.”

/// In this construction, の may not be used in place of こと

<br>

/// Negative or positive responses are reflected in the last verb, ある, rather than in the non-final verb.

<br>

寿司を食べたことがありますか。//Have you ever eaten sushi?

ええ、あります。//Yes, I have.

<br>

/// In a negative response, it is common to add 一度も {いちども} “not even once” to the negative ありませ ん

<br>

いいえ、一度もありません。//No. Not even once.

<br>

/// The imperfective form should not be used before ことがある to talk about a past experience; this construction has quite a different meaning from the one with the perfective form.

<br>

### (3) [Perfective verb] ほうがいい

/// The functional noun 方 {ほう}, which literally means “side” or “way,” is used to suggest or indicate a better or preferred way to do something.

/// For this construction, the verb must be in the perfective form.

/// The perfective form is preferred in this fixed phrase because one can judge something to be good only after the action is completed.

/// This assumed completion is expressed with the perfective form.

<br>

明日、行った方がいいですよ。//You’d better go tomorrow.

<br>

/// For a negative suggestion, the negative imperfective should be used.

<br>

明日、行かない方がいいですよ。//It would be better if you didn’t go tomorrow.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: [Specific Name] と いう [Generic Name]

### (1) In a statement

/// This construction is used when the speaker assumes that the addressee does not know the specific name of the thing being discussed.

/// This expression is rather formulaic, insofar as the first noun should be a specific name, and the second noun should be a category that the specific thing named by the first noun belongs to.

/// という comes from the quotative particle と and the verb 言う {いう}, but in this expression, いう is not written in kanji.

<br>

/// 東京という所 “a place called Tokyo”

/// マイクという学生 “a student called Mike”

/// すしという食べ物 “a food called sushi”

/// 音楽というもの “a thing called music”

<br>



私はナンシーという学生に会いました。//I met a student called Nancy.

高校の先生は鈴木という先生でした。//I had a high school teacher called Suzuki

<br>

### (2) Definition

/// There are many different ways to ask for definitions.

<br>

旅行という言葉は英語で何ですか。//What is the word for 'Ryokou' in English?

<br>

/// The pronoun の may be used in place of 言葉 {ことば} in the above sentence because the referent is clear from the context.

<br>

旅行というのは英語で何ですか。//What’s the word for 'Ryokou' in English?

<br>

/// There are many sentence structures that can be used to give definitions. The following is one such structure:

<br>

旅行というのはトラベルという意味です。//'Ryokou' means ‘travel.’

<br>

/// どういう is often used to ask for defining or rephrasing a word, a phrase, etc.

<br>

読書というのはどういう意味ですか。//What does 'Dokusho' mean?

<br>

/// ということ is often used when defining something by rephrasing.

<br>

読書というのは本を読むということです。//'Dokusho' means to read a book.

<br>

### (3) ということ

/// is used to rephrase the content of a message.

<br>

私はあの人はー年生だということを聞きました。//I heard someone saying that he was a freshman.

私は昨日のテストは易しかったということを聞きました。//I heard someone saying that yesterday’s test was easy.

<br>

/// Compare the above with the following:

<br>

私はあの人は一年生だと聞きました。//I heard someone saying that guy was a freshman.

私は昨日のテストは易しかったと聞きました。//I heard someone saying that yesterday’s test was easy.

<br>

/// The difference between the sentences with and without ということ is as follows:

/// - Sentences without ということ express the content of what the speaker has heard directly.

/// - Sentences with ということ indicate that the speaker has rephrased his or her own understanding from what he or she has heard someone say about the content.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) What did she say?

<br>

お母さん、何て？//What did Mom say?

うん。あまり好きじゃないって。//Um, she said she didn’t like it all that much.

<br>

#### 何て {なんて}？

/// 何て is a colloquial version of 何と言いましたか “What did (someone) say?” This expression is used very often in conversation.

<br>

/// ~って in spoken language is a shortened version of と言いました, meaning “(someone) said such-and-such.”

/// Therefore, the content of the message goes before ~って.

<br>

### (2) What do you mean?

<br>

それ、どういうこと？　行かないっていうこと？//What do you mean by that? Does that mean you won’t go?

まあ、そういうこと。//Yeah, pretty much.

<br>



#### どういうこと

/// This expression is used to ask for some clarification of what the speaker has just heard the addressee say; it means something like “What do you mean by that?”

<br>

/// ~っていうこと used in the predicate is a colloquial version of ということ, meaning “I mean (content).”

<br>

#### そういうこと

/// This expression is used to concur with what the other person has said, thought, or assumed.

/// When used in a question, it is used to confirm the other person’s (or sometimes one’s own) understanding of what was said.

/// こういうこと may also be used to summarize what the speaker has said.

<br>

### (3) What does it mean?

<br>

登山って、どういう意味？//What does 'tosan' mean?

山に登るってことよ。//It means to climb mountains.

<br>

#### ~って in the first clause

/// 登山って {とざんって} is a shortened spoken version of 登山というのは.

/// 登る {のぼる} means “to climb.”

<br>

### (4) That’s too bad

<br>

彼、何て行ってた？//What did he say?

行かないって。//He said he’s not going.

そう。残念だけど、しかたないね。//Really. That’s too bad, but what can we do?

<br>

#### 残念 {ざんねん}

/// This adjectival noun means that the speaker feels sorry about what he or she has just heard or learned about.

<br>

#### しかたない

/// This is a shortened phrase; the complete expression is しかたがない.

/// しかた means “way of dealing with something.”

/// So, the literal meaning of this expression is “There’s no way to deal with this.”

/// This phrase, which is used when the speaker wishes to indicate that he or she will have to accept a situation as it is.

/// Another expression, しようがない, has the same meaning as しかたがない;

/// しようがない is often contracted to しょうがない when speaking colloquially.stage ２，３。

# Stage 2-2 Adjectival Clauses

## 1: Adverbial Clauses

### (1) The concept of adverbial clauses

/// Two types of adverbial clauses were introduced. 

/// The first type uses the conjunction から to give a reason for something.

/// The second type indicates a time condition by using conjunctions 時 {とき}, 前 {まえ}, and 後 {あと}.

<br>

### (2) Adverbial clauses with the causal conjunction から

/// the cause or reason for a certain consequence may be expressed in a dependent clause joined by the conjunction から.

<br>

どうして、昨日、授業を休みましたか。//Why were you absent from class yesterday?

昨日、私は、母が病気だったから、授業を休みました。//I didn’t go to class yesterday because my mother was sick.

<br>

/// There are a few important points to remember for these constructions:

/// - Of the three interrogative pronouns, なぜ is the most formal, followed by どうして, and then なん で, the most colloquial.

/// - The predicate form before から is normally in the plain form, although the polite form may be used in very polite speech.

/// - The main clause in the response may be abbreviated by だ（or です） in conversation.

/// - When the topics in the dependent and independent clauses are not the same, use が for the topic in the dependent clause and は for the independent clause.

<br>

/// In fact, there are a few more dependent clauses that express causes and reasons.

/// It may be useful, at this point, to know that the clausal conjunction ので may also be used to connect the cause-dependent clause and the main clause.

<br>

昨日、私は病気だったので、授業を休みました。//I was sick yesterday, so I didn’t go to class.

<br>

/// In most cases, から and ので are interchangeable, but there are some differences;

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Temporal Adverbial Clauses

### (1) Temporal adverbial clauses joined by 時 {とき}

/// a time condition may be expressed by an adverbial clause joined by the conjunction 時.

<br>

#### Predicate aspectual forms before the conjunction 時 {とき}

/// The following example uses the sentential conjunction その時:

<br>

明日、私は森さんに会います。ぞの時に、私達は日本語で話します。//I’ll meet Mori-san tomorrow. At that time, we’ll speak in Japanese.

<br>

/// The two sentences above may be changed into a complex sentence by using 時 as the clausal conjunction

<br>

明日、私が森さんに会った時に、私は日本語で話します。//When I meet Mori-san tomorrow, we’ll speak in Japanese.

<br>

/// In the sentence above, the verb is in the perfective form, 会った {あった}, despite the fact that the speaker has not met Mori-san yet, because the speaker intends to speak to Mori-san after the act of meeting has taken place.

/// Remember, the perfective form indicates only the completion of an event, not the past tense.

<br>

#### Stative predicates in the adverbial clauses

/// When the predicate in an adverbial clause is stative in nature, its form does not change, regardless of the form in the main clause.

<br>

寒い時、コートを着ます。//I wear a coat when it’s cold.

寒い時、コートを着ました。//I wore a coat when it was cold.

<br>

#### Aspectual forms in adverbial clauses

/// The aspectual forms of movement verbs illustrate the imperfective and perfective aspects clearly, regardless of the time of the event. In the examples below, imagine a situation that includes the following two events:

### (1) going to Japan from America; and (2) buying a dictionary.

<br>

/// In all cases, the aspectual form of the predicate in the main clause is what indicates whether both events have taken place or not.

/// There are four possible situations:

<br>

日本に行く時、辞書を買います。//I will buy a dictionary before going to Japan.

日本に行った時、辞書を買います。//I will buy a dictionary in Japan after I arrive there.

日本に行く時、辞書を買いました。//I bought a dictionary before I arrived in Japan.

日本に行った時、辞書を買いました。//I bought a dictionary in Japan after I arrived there.

<br>

### (2) Temporal adverbial clauses joined by 前 {まえ}

/// the plain positive imperfective must be used before 前に, as the time condition indicates that the action in the adverbial clause is incomplete when the action in the main clause takes or has taken place.

/// This is true regardless of the time the sentence expresses in the main predicate.

<br>

ルームメートが１０時に寝る前に、私はテレビを見ます。//I’ll watch TV before my roommate goes to bed at 10:00.

ルームメートが１０時に寝る前に、私はテレビを見ました。//I watched TV before my roommate went to bed at 10:00.

<br>

### (3) Temporal adverbial clauses joined by 後 {あと}

/// Similarly, the plain positive perfective form must be used before 後で, as the adverbial clause indicates an action completed before the action in the main clause takes or has taken place.

/// This is true regardless of the time of the sentence shows in the main predicate.

<br>

ルームメートが１０時に寝た後で、私はテレビを見ます。//I’ll watch TV after my roommate goes to bed at 10:00.

ルームメートが１０時に寝た後で、私はテレビを見ました。//I watched TV after my roommate went to bed at 10:00.

<br>

### (4) Use of 前 {まえ} and 後 {あと} with numbers

/// 前 and 後 can be used immediately after numbers that indicate time.

<br>

三年前に日本に行きました。//I went to Japan three years ago.

三年後で日本に行きました。//I went to Japan three years later.

三年後に日本に行きました。//I went to Japan three years later.

<br>

/// 三年後 may be pronounced either さんねんあと or さんねんご.

/// The pronunciation of the kanji 後 depends on whether the particle に or で is used.

/// If で is used, the phrase is pronounced さんねんあと; if に is used, it is pronounced さんねんご.

/// The particle に is optional after 三年前 and 三年後 {さんねんご}, but で must follow 三年後 {さんねんあと}.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Situational Adverbial Clauses Joined by the たら-forms

### (1) たら-forms

/// Adverbial clauses that indicate conditions of time are often expressed in English with “when” and “if.”

/// It is important for the students not to try to correlate the words “when” and “if” directly to specific structures in Japanese.

/// Rather, it is more important to understand the basic meanings that these Japanese structures express.

/// There are quite a few adverbial clauses that express time-related conditions.

/// In this section, one such adverbial clause will be introduced.

/// This is called the たら adverbial clause because its predicate ends with ~たら.

<br>

/// For now, the 時 {とき}and たら adverbial clauses are distinguished as follows:

/// the condition expressed in the 時 adverbial clause is temporal (“at the time when”), while the condition in the たら adverbial clause is situational (“if and when the situation is such-and-such”).

<br>

/// The rules to derive the たら-forms are quite simple: just add ~ら to the ending of the perfective form ~た or ~だ.

/// Verbal: Perfective form + ら

/// Adjectival: ~い → ~かったら

/// Nominal (copula): だ → だったら

/// Negative predicate: ~ない → ~なかったら

<br>

### (2) When the predicate of the main clause is in the imperfective form

/// The たら-form can be used to express a situational condition under which a certain outcome will occur.

/// In this case, the main clause is always in the imperfective form.

<br>

日本に行ったら、日本語が上手に成ると思います。//If you go to Japan, I believe your Japanese will improve.

車がもっと安かったら、買います。//If cars were cheaper, I would buy one.

あの部屋が静かだったら、あそこで勉強します。//If that room is quiet, I will study there.

<br>

### (3) When the predicate of the main clause is in the perfective form

/// The たら-form in the adverbial clause can also indicate circumstances under which an unexpected event occurred.

/// In this case, the predicate form in the main clause is always perfective.

<br>

家に帰ったら、母が来ていました。//To my surprise, when I returned home, my mother was there.

クラスに行ったら、だれもいませんでした。//To my surprise, when I went to class, no one was there.

<br>

### (4) Difference between the たら-adverbial and the とき-adverbial

/// The main difference between sentences with adverbial clauses using 時 {とき}and those using ~たら is that with 時, the focus of the sentence is when the event expressed in the main clause happened or will happen.

/// With ~たら, on the other hand, sentence focuses on what happened or will happen under the situation expressed in the ~たら clause.

<br>

/// Compare the two responses to the following question:

<br>

いつ聞きましょうか。//When shall we ask him?

<br>

林さんが来た時に、聞きましょう。//Let’s ask Hayashi-san when he gets here.

林さんが来たら、聞きましょう。//If Hayashi-san comes, let’s ask him.

<br>

/// The difference between the adverbial clauses above is that,

/// with the 時-adverbial, the speaker knows that Hayashi-san will arrive at some point;

/// with the たら-adverbial, Hayashi-san’s arrival is uncertain.

<br>

/// When the speaker is not certain that the conditions given will be met, the use of the たら-adverbial is more appropriate than the 時-adverbial.

<br>

林さんが来たら、どうしましょうか。//What should we do if Hayashi-san comes here?

<br>

/// 時 {とき}-adverbial clauses may not be used when the consequence expressed in the main clause is not controllable.

/// 困る {こまる} means “to be in trouble.”

<br>

林さんが来たら、困ります。//I’ll be in trouble if Hayashi-san comes here.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Situational Adverbial Clauses Joined by と

/// Another example of situational adverbial clauses is a construction in which the adverbial and main clauses are joined by the conditional conjunction と.

/// In this construction, the predicate preceding the conjunction と must be in the imperfective form.

<br>

### (1) When the predicate of the main clause is in the imperfective form

#### Natural consequences

/// When the predicate of the main clause is in the imperfective form, the sentence expresses the natural consequence of the situation described in the adverbial clause.

/// In these cases, the consequence is something that the speaker has no control over; it occurs naturally.

<br>

春に成ると、暖かく成ります。//Once spring comes, it will get warmer.

もっと漢字を勉強すると、日本語は易しく成ります。//Once you study more kanji, Japanese will get easier.

<br>

#### Habitual consequences

/// “Natural consequences” and “habitual consequences” are related,

/// but habitual consequences usually concern personal and controllable events rather than a natural, uncontrollable outcome.

<br>

/// This construction indicates that every time the event described in the adverbial clause occurs, the speaker or the topic does what is expressed in the main clause.

<br>

日本に行くと、井上さんに会います。//Whenever I go to Japan, I see Inoue-san.

クラスが終わると、いつも図書館で宿題をします。//After class, I always do my homework in the library.

<br>

### (2) When the predicate of the main clause is in the perfective form

/// When the predicate of the main clause is in the perfective form in this construction, it expresses an event occurring immediately after the situation described in the adverbial clause.

/// The adverb すぐ（に） “immediately” often accompanies the main clause.

<br>

家に帰ると、友達から電話がありました。//As soon as I returned home, I got a phone call from a friend.

朝ご飯を食べると、すぐ大学に行きました。//As soon as I ate breakfast, I went to college.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Representative Expressions

/// the particle や is used to indicate that items in addition to those mentioned are included in the sentence.

/// For instance, the phrase 本やペン indicates that the speaker is implying that there are more than just books and pens.

/// However,や may not be used to list predicates.

<br>

/// To list predicates, the speaker must use the たり-form (also called the representative form), with the verb する used in the final position of the sentence.

/// This is called the representative form because it is used when the speaker chooses to mention a few representative events out of many that could be listed.

<br>

/// As with the て-form, the たり-form alone does not make a meaningful grammatical sentence.

/// In the most common structure, the actions or the descriptions made with the たり-form must be concluded with the verb する.

/// The meaning of the sentence with the representative form, however, will differ depending upon the type of the predicate.

<br>

### (1) たり-formation (representative form)

/// To create the representative form, add り to the perfective form of the predicate.

<br>

### (2) Verbal predicates

/// The following exchange shows how ~たり is used in conversation:

<br>

昨日、何をしましたか。//What did you do yesterday?

昨日、料理したり、映画に行ったりしました。//I cooked, and went to a movie—things like that.

<br>

/// The たり-form is used twice within the response above.

/// It is common, though not obligatory, to use the たり-form twice.

/// Sometimes it is only used once; at other times, it may be used more than twice.

<br>

/// Note that the たり-form, like the conjunctive form, does not convey aspect.

/// Aspect is always indicated by the final verb, する. In the example above, the final verb is in the perfective form.

/// In the following examples, the main clauses are in the imperfective form and in the command construction.

<br>

明日、料理したり、映画に行ったりします。//Tomorrow I will cook, and go to the movies, and do other things like that.

土曜日には、料理したり、映画に行ったりしてください。//Please cook, and go to the movies, and do other things like that on Saturday.

<br>

### (3) Adjectival predicates

/// Since the primary function of adjectives is to describe, the たり-forms of adjectives with the verb する in a sentence are used to give different descriptions for different times.

<br>

日本語のテストは難しかったり、易しかったりします。//Sometimes Japanese exams are difficult and sometimes they’re easy.

この店のケーキは美味しかったり、美味しくなかったりです。//Cakes at this store sometimes taste great, but sometimes they’re not so good.

<br>

/// The copula in the second sentence functions to abbreviate the predicate with する.

/// This construction is commonly used.

<br>

/// When different descriptions apply to different things or people, they do not necessarily refer to different times:

<br>

この学校の先生は優しかったり、優しくなかったりします。//Some teachers at this school are lenient and some are not.

<br>

### (4) Nominal predicates

/// The function of the たり-form of the copula is the same as that of the adjective.

/// The following examples illustrate the different aspects of the final verb する.

<br>

今年の日本語のテストの日は月曜日だったり火曜日だったりしています。//The day of this year’s Japanese tests has sometimes been Monday and sometimes Tuesday.

今年の日本語のテストの日は月曜日だったり火曜日だったりします。//The day of this year’s Japanese tests is sometimes Monday and sometimes Tuesday.

<br>



/// The difference between しています and します at the end of the above two sentences is aspectual.

/// しています implies the current situation while します implies a general description of the testing situation.

<br>

/// The example below is somewhat ambiguous:

<br>

日本語の先生はアメリカ人の先生だったり日本人の先生だったりです。//Some of the Japanese teachers are American, and some are Japanese.

<br>

/// Though the translation above is the most likely interpretation, this sentence could also be read as “Sometimes an American teacher comes to the Japanese class, and at other times it’s a Japanese teacher.”

/// The meaning in such cases depends on the context.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 6: Conjunctions

### (1) Clausal conjunction し

/// The conjunction し is used between two independent clauses.

/// The function of this conjunction is to add information, much like そして, except that it is used between clauses rather than sentences.

<br>

あの人は、頭もいいし、顔もきれいですね。//That person is not only smart, but she also has a very pretty face.

<br>

/// Like けれども, the form of the first clause can be either in the plain form or the polite form when the predicate of the second clause is in the polite form.

<br>

あの人は、頭もいいし、顔もきれいだし、私は大好きです。//I like her a lot because she is smart and pretty.

あの人は、頭もいいですし、顔もきれいですし、私は大好きです。//I like her a lot because she is smart and pretty.

<br>

/// As the sentences above indicate, し may be used as a conjunction after an adverbial clause giving the reason for the statement made in the main clause.

<br>

### (2) Sentential conjunction その上 {そのうえ}

/// The conjunction その上 is sentential rather than clausal.

/// The second sentence gives additional information.

<br>

あの人は本当に頭がいいです。その上、顔もきれいです。//That person is really smart. On top of that, she’s pretty, too.

<br>

### (3) Sentential conjunctions すると and そしたら（そうしたら）

/// と and ~たら used in sentences in this chapter may also be used as independent sentential conjunctions in the forms すると and そしたら（そうしたら）.

/// When they are used to join sentences, these conjunctions function the same as と and ~たら used for adverbial clauses.

<br>

/// Recall that when と is used between an adverbial clause and the main clause with a perfective predicate, the event in the main clause is immediate.

<br>

部屋に入った。すると、電話が鳴った。//I entered the room. Immediately after that, the phone rang.

<br>

/// ~たら in the adverbial clause expresses that the event indicated in the main clause is unexpected.

/// In this case, the predicate in the main clause must be in the perfective form.

/// The sentential conjunction そしたら expresses this nuance.

/// そしたら is used more like a clause, meaning something like “after doing that, to my surprise...”

<br>

病気で学校を休んだ。そしたら、先生から電話があった。//I was sick, so I didn’t go to school. My teacher surprised me by calling me on the phone because I was absent.

妹にケーキを上げた。そしたら、妹は泣いた。//I gave my sister a piece of cake. She surprised me by bursting into tears in response.

/// In conversation it is used often, even within the same sentence.

<br>

#### 別にたいしたことない

/// The adverb 別に {べつに}, which must accompany a negative predicate, means “not particularly.”

<br>

これは別に美味しくありません。//This is not especially tasty.

<br>

/// たいしたことない is an idiomatic phrase meaning “nothing serious” or “not a big deal.”

<br>

#### 電話してあげる

/// あげる, one of the verbs of giving, is combined with the verb 電話する {でんわする} to mean, in the above context, “call your sister to see if everything is all right.” This structure will be covered in detail in the next chapter.

<br>

#### 具合が悪い {ぐあい が わるい}

/// 具合 {ぐあい} is a noun that means “condition” or “situation.”

/// This noun can be used for a thing (such as a machine) or a person.

/// When it is used for a person, it usually refers to their health.

/// Therefore, 具合が悪い, when discussing a person, means they are “not feeling well” or are “feeling sick.”

<br>

/// といいです expresses the speaker’s wish for a certain situation.

#### わるいけど

/// This expression can be used when the speaker feels guilty about asking a favor of the addressee.

/// It means “I’m really sorry, but...”

<br>

#### 待ってくれない？ (まってくれない？)

/// This is a casual way of asking 待ってくださいませんか.

<br>

#### と困る {こまる}

/// Therefore, 先に行く means “to go before another person.”

/// 行ってて here is the same as 行っていて.

<br>

#### 申し訳ないけど {もう し わけ ないけど}

/// 申し訳ないけど is a more polite version of わるいけど.

/// Even in a casual conversation, a speaker can use 申し訳ないけど, an expression equivalent to “I am truly sorry.”

/// The use of a more humble expression conveys the depth of the speaker’s regret.

/// The polite predicate ありません instead of ない may also be used to make the expression more polite: 申し訳ありませんが.

/// The conjunction が is more formal than the colloquial けど.stage ２，４。

# Stage 2-4 Derived Verbs: Potentials and Passives

<br>

## 1: Potential Verbs and Sentences

### (1) Derived verbs

/// the three types of derived verbs include potential, passive, and causative verbs.

<br>

### (2) Potential verbs

/// When potential verbs were introduced as independent verbs, only their ability-related meaning was given.

/// however, potential verbs can also express possibility (that is, something that is possible in some situations).

<br>

#### Ability-related meaning

/// The following sentences express the topic’s ability to do something.

<br>

クリスさんは日本語が上手に話せます。//Kurisu-san can speak Japanese well.

私は運転できません。//I cannot drive.

<br>

#### Possibility-related meaning

/// Some verbs that do not involve skill or action indicate only possibility, not ability.

<br>

明日は日本語の授業に行けません。//I cannot go to Japanese class tomorrow.

ナンシーさんは明日から図書館でアルバイトできます。//It will be possible for Nancy to work at the library starting tomorrow.

日本に三週間いられます。//I can stay in Japan for three weeks.

<br>

/// Derived potential forms of action verbs have both ability- and possibility-related meanings depending on the context.

/// For instance, the potential verb 話せる may be used for both meanings. (See above for the ability-related meaning with this verb.)

/// As for the possibility-related meaning with the potential forms of action verbs, the topic is often not explicitly expressed.

<br>

この店では日本語が話せます。//In this store, we can speak Japanese.

<br>

#### Expressing possibility-related meaning with かもしれない

/// Some semi-transitive verbs, such as 分かる and ある, have no potential forms because this type of verb does not refer to an action, and thus cannot express ability.

/// Other constructions must be used to express the idea of possibility with these verbs.

<br>

/// One construction that can be used to express possibility with these verbs is the sentence-ending expression かもしれない.

<br>

あの人はお金がたくさんあるかもしれません。//It’s possible that that person has a lot of money.

あの人は日本語が分かるかもしれません。//It’s possible that that person understands Japanese.

<br>

/// When the speaker wants to express more certainty that the situation is true, the volitional copula だろう may be used.

<br>

あの人はお金がたくさんあるでしょう。//I’m quite certain that that person has a lot of money.

あの人は日本語が分かるでしょう。//I’m sure that that person understands Japanese.

<br>

/// In either case, the possibilities expressed by the potential forms and those expressed by かもしれな い or だろう are not quite parallel to each other.

<br>

/// With the potential form, the possibility lies in whether or not the topic is able to carry out the action.

/// When かもしれない or だろう are used, the possibility lies in whether or not the situation is true, with somewhat different degrees of uncertainty.

/// For this reason, both かもしれない and だろう may be used even with potential verbs.

<br>

あの店では日本語が話せるかもしれません。//You may be able to speak Japanese at that store.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Passive Verbs and Sentences

### (1) Passive verb formation

/// Group 1, 2: Change the final vowel u to the vowel a and add れる

/// Group 3: [する → される], [くる → こられる]

<br>

/// all derived passive forms are Group 1 verbs.

<br>

### (2) Different passive sentences in Japanese

/// In both English and Japanese, passive sentences appear more often in formal writing than in casual speech.

<br>

/// In Japanese, there are two different kinds of passive sentences.

/// - One is a regular passive, used most often in formal writing or speech.

/// - The other is a passive expressing that the speaker has been affected by a certain event, resulting in a feeling that is often undesirable.

/// This type of passive, which is used rather frequently in daily conversation, is called the affective passive.

/// Because this type of passive is emotive, the topic is normally the speaker.

<br>

### (3) Regular passive sentences

/// The use of regular passives occurs most often in written work such as essays, or in formal speech.

/// The topic of the essay is often used as the topic of passive sentences.

/// For instance, if an essay is discussing 日本語, 日本語 may be used as the topic of the essay’s opening statement.

<br>

日本語は日本でだけ話されています。//Japanese is spoken only in Japan.

<br>

/// Regular passives do have active counterparts

<br>

この大学では、多くの学生が日本語を勉強しています。//Many students study Japanese at this college.

この大学では、日本語は多くの学生に勉強されています。//At this college, Japanese is studied by many students.

<br>

/// The particle に is used to mark the person who does the action in a regular passive sentence.

/// によって instead of に can also be used in some cases.

<br>

この本は有名な作家に書かれました。//This book was written by a famous writer.

この本は有名な作家によって書かれました。//This book was written by a famous writer.

<br>

/// While the particle に and によって may mark the person who acts, に is the particle used for all types of passive predicates.

/// によって is not used for the verbs that have emotive meanings, such as scolding and praising, as shown in the incorrect sentence below.

/// In cases when both に and によって are acceptable, the use of によって sounds more formal than に.

<br>

日本の生徒は先生に時々、叱られます。//Students in Japan are occasionally scolded by their teachers.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Affective passive sentences

/// In English, because passive sentences are formed by making the object of the active sentence into the subject of the passive sentence, only transitive sentences can be converted into passive sentences.

<br>

/// In Japanese, passive verbs can also be used in sentences in which the speaker expresses an emotional response to an event.

/// Feelings such as annoyance or surprise can be conveyed by the use of passive verbs.

/// In this type of passive sentence, even intransitive action verbs may be used in some situations.

/// However, semi-transitive verbs, and the intransitive counterpart of a transitive-intransitive verb pair (such as the intransitive, 始まる {はじまる}, whose transitive counterpart is 始める {はじめる})

/// may not be used even in affective passives.

<br>

/// The structures of the regular passive and affective passive are inherently different.

/// In affective passives, the person who is affected—again, most often the speaker—is the topic of the sentence.

/// Unlike regular passive sentences, the topic of the affective passive does not appear in the active counterpart

<br>

/// Active:

<br>

雨がふりました。//It rained.

<br>

/// Passive:

<br>

私は雨に降られました。//I was affected by the fact that rain fell.

<br>



去年、私達は犬に死なれました。//Last year, we were saddened by the death of our dog.

私は映画館で子供に泣かれました。//I was really annoyed by the child’s crying in the theater.

私は先生に私の家に来られました。//I was shocked that my teacher came to my house.

<br>

/// The sentences above are translated idiomatically, as there is really no way to provide word-for-word translations for sentences of this type.

<br>

/// Unlike a regular passive, when a transitive sentence is converted into an affective passive, the direct object in the active sentence remains the direct object in the affective passive.

/// The person affected by the event is the topic, and does not appear in the active sentence.

<br>

/// Active:

<br>

友達はボーイフレンドからの手紙を読みました。//My friend read my boyfriend’s letter.

<br>

/// Passive:

<br>

私は友達にボーイフレンドからの手紙を読まれました。//I was upset that my friend read my boyfriend's letter.

<br>

/// In many affective passive sentences, the topic is not mentioned, because it is clear that the speaker is the one who is emotionally affected.

<br>

/// Some passives are affective passives by nature, even though they have the structure of a regular passive, because of the inherent meaning of the verb.

/// This is particularly true of emotive verbs.

<br>

/// Active:

<br>

先生は私を叱りました。//The teacher scolded me.

<br>

/// Passive:

<br>

私は先生に叱られました。//I was upset about being scolded by the teacher.

<br>

#### Affective passives with ~てしまう

/// ~てしまう is often used with the affective passives.

/// Recall that ~てしまう may be used to express a certain unexpected and unintentional result.

/// As the circumstances in which affective passives are used are by nature unexpected, this resultative expression is commonly used in affective passive sentences.

<br>

昨日、先生に叱られてしまいました。//I ended up being scolded by the teacher.

卒業式で雨に降られてしまいました。//It turned out that it rained at the graduation ceremony.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (5) Passive and potential sentences

/// In terms of their formation, the passive and potential forms of Group 1 verbs and 来る {くる} are identical.

/// The two forms are used in different structures, however, so the meanings of each are clear.

<br>

このケーキが食べられますか。//Can you eat this cake?

私は妹にケーキを食べられました。//I was upset that my sister ate my cake.

<br>

/// Unlike Group 1 verbs, potentials and passives of the Group 2 verbs and する have different forms.

<br>

ここで日本語が話せます。//We can speak Japanese here.

日本語はここでも話されています。//Japanese is spoken even here.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (6) Passives in English and Japanese

/// When the speaker receives some kind of benefit, the use of a passive sentence is not appropriate in Japanese.

<br>

/// It is allowed in English, however, as in the following example:

/// - Japanese is taught by Professor Tanaka.

/// - I was taught Japanese by Professor Tanaka.

/// The second sentence cannot be expressed as a passive sentence in Japanese, because the implication is that the topic is receiving some kind of benefit or favor from Professor Tanaka.

<br>

/// To express this meaning, the following structure must be used:

<br>

私は田中先生に日本語を教えていただきました。//I was taught Japanese by Tanaka-sensei.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: て-forms with Giving and Receiving Verbs

/// All verbs of giving and receiving may be combined with other verbs in the て-form.

/// In these cases, what the topic gives and receives are the benefits of actions rather than things.

/// The central meaning of this construction is therefore “doing a favor for or receiving a favor from another individual.”

/// In English, this nuance is expressed by the preposition “for,” as in “I read the book for the child,” or “Mary made the cake for me.” 

<br>

### (1) ~てあげる（さしあげる・やる）

/// This construction indicates that the topic does a favor for another person.

/// The use of あげる, さしあげる, and やる depends on the relationship between the topic and the recipient of the favor.

<br>

私は母に英語の手紙を読んであげました。//I read the letter in English for my mother.

私は友達のおばあさんに新聞を読んでさしあげました。//I read the newspaper for my friend’s grandmother.

私は弟の宿題をしてやりました。//I did my younger brother’s homework for him.

<br>

/// This construction should be used with care, because when a speaker talks about doing a favor for others, it can seem boastful in the context of Japanese culture.

/// The topic may do something for someone voluntarily, or at the request of the receiver; it is not always clear which is the case.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) ~てくれる（くださる）

/// When the verbs くれる or くださる are used, the recipient is always the speaker or the speaker’s うちgroup.

/// The particle が is often used as the topic marker in this type of sentence because the sentence often expresses who is the person who has offered or will offer the favor.

<br>

ルームメートがこの漢字を教えてくれました。//My roommate is the one who taught me this kanji.

伊藤先生がこの漢字を教えてくださいました。//Ito-sensei is the one who taught me this kanji.

時雨さんが弟に本を読んでくれました。//Shigure-sensei is the one who taught me this kanji.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) ~てもらう（いただく）

/// This construction is used when the topic receives a favor from someone else,

/// most often as the result of a request or in a prearranged situation.

<br>

僕はルームメートにこの漢字を教えてもらいました。//I had my roommate teach me this kanji.

マイクさんは鈴木先生にこの漢字を教えていただきました。//Mike asked Professor Suzuki to teach him this kanji.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Comparison between ~てくれる and ~てもらう

/// The following is a summary of the different situations in which ~てくれる（くださる） and ~てもらう（いただく） may be used.

/// In both of the sentences below, Taro, a man, read the letter for the speaker:

<br>

太郎さんが日本語の手紙を読んでくれました。//Taro read the Japanese letter for me.

私は日本語の手紙を太郎さんに読んでもらいました。//I had Taro read the Japanese letter for me.

<br>

/// The person who did the action of reading the letter is in the topic position in the sentence with ~くれる（くださる）.

/// In contrast, the person who has asked and received the favor is the topic in the sentence with ~もらう（いただく）.

<br>

/// In the first sentence with ~くれる（くださる）, the focus is Taro, who has offered the action of reading.

/// This action may have taken place because the speaker has asked Taro to do so, or Taro may have volunteered (the use of が for the topic indicates the latter).

<br>

/// In the second sentence with ~もらう（いただく）, the speaker asked Taro to read the letter, perhaps because the speaker cannot read Japanese.

/// As a result of this request, the speaker (the topic) received Taro’s help, namely, the reading of the letter.

/// In this case, the speaker is the topic, since the speaker initiated the asking, and the sentence is structured to communicate this fact.

/// This construction is generally used to talk about a favor that the speaker has received as the result of his or her own request.

<br>

#### Causative sentences and ~てもらう（いただく）

/// causative verbs can be used in sentences in which one person makes another do something.

/// This may seem similar to the sentences with ~てもらう（いただく）.

/// The difference is that the topic of a causative sentence is usually someone who has a certain authority over the person whom the topic makes do something; this is not the case with sentences with ~てもらう （いただく）.

/// Another difference is that sentences with ~てもらう（いただく） imply that the topic has requested that another do something, while causative sentences do not imply any such request.

<br>

先生は学生に漢字を書かせました。//The teacher made the students write kanji.

先生は学生に漢字を書いてもらいました。//The teacher had a student write kanji for him.

<br>

#### Noun のために

/// This phrase, a noun with のために, is used to indicate the recipient of a favor in some constructions.

/// ために, rather than に, is used to avoid confusion as to whether the destination or the beneficiary is being named.

<br>

/// Suppose the speaker’s grandmother is ill, so she cannot go shopping.

/// In this situation, the grandmother is the beneficiary on whose behalf the speaker is going to the store.

<br>

/// It is better to use ために in place of the first に:

<br>

私は叔母さんのために店に行ってあげました。//I went to the store for my grandmother.

<br>

/// ために may also be used in cases when に is normally used to indicate the beneficiary of the topic’s action.

/// When both ために and に are possible, the benefit is much more greatly emphasized with た めに than に.

/// Because of this, an inappropriate use of ために may convey the nuance that the gift was overbearing.

<br>

私はおばあさんのためにおいしいケーキを作ってあげました。//I made a great cake for my grandmother.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: て-forms for Expressing the Cause

### (1) Different causes

/// Up to this point in the course, only the adverbial clause with the conjunction から has been introduced to express cause.

/// Clauses with ので also express cause.

/// Another way to express cause is to end the first clause with the て-form.

/// This indicates that the first clause is the reason for the result expressed in the second clause.

/// The distinction in this construction is that the result occurs naturally, rather than being a result of the speaker’s action:

<br>

漢字が難しくて、私はこの本が読めません。//I can’t read this book because the kanji are too difficult.

<br>

/// Emotive expressions, such as the verb 困る {こまる} in the following sentence, are often used in the result clause:

<br>

雨が降って、困りました。//It rained, and that caused me some problems.

<br>

### (2) Apologizing

/// Ending the first clause with the て-form is a construction commonly used to form an apology:

<br>

昨日、授業に来なくて、すみません （でした）。//I’m sorry I didn’t come to class yesterday.

<br>

/// A very common mistake when expressing an apology is to connect the two clauses with the conjunction から (or ので)

<br>

/// An apology is best connected with the て-form because it indicates that the speaker’s regret emerges naturally, rather than being the chosen consequence of a causal event.

<br>

### (3) Thanking

/// If the speaker is thanking someone for a specific thing that he or she received, を is used, though it may be deleted in casual conversation:

<br>

面白い本をありがとうございます。//Thank you for the interesting book.

<br>

/// When a speaker thanks someone else, it is because that person has done something nice for him or her.

/// It is therefore most natural that, following the main clause, the first clause contains some kind of giving or receiving verb.

/// Without this, the expression is often inappropriate.

<br>

手伝ってくれて、ありがとう。//Thank you for helping me.

<br>

/// The following is a more polite version of the above sentence; the verb くださる is used rather than く れる, with ございます added at the end.

<br>

手伝ってくださって、ありがとうございます。//Thank you for helping me.

<br>

/// Mistakes commonly made when expressing appreciation include 

/// 1. not using a verb of giving or receiving;

/// 2. joining the first clause to the second clause by から (or ので);

/// 3. using a form other than the て-form in the first clause.

<br>

<br>

### (1) Thanking someone for advice

<br>

今日も授業で皆に笑われたんです。//People laughed at me again today in class.

ええ？ そうなんですか。どうしたんですか。//Really? Tell me what happened.

全然、知りませんでした。教えてくださって、本当にありがとうございます。//I didn’t know that at all. Thank you very much for telling me.

<br>

#### どうしたんですか

/// the use of ~んですか suggests that the speaker is urging or encouraging the addressee to explain the situation.

<br>

### (2) How did you get here?

<br>

どうやってここまで来られたんですか。//How did you manage to get here?

父に乗せてもらって来たんです。//I asked my father to give me a ride.

<br>

#### どうやって

/// やって in this phrase is from the verb やる “to do,” a colloquial verb equivalent in meaning to する.

/// どうやって is a way of asking how things are done.

<br>

#### 乗せてもらって

/// 乗せる {のせる} is a verb meaning “to give a ride.”

<br>

彼は私を車に乗せてくれた。//He gave me a ride in his car.

<br>

### (3) Feeling upset about a bad grade

<br>

中間試験、ものすごく悪い点をつけられました。//I got a really bad grade on the midterm.

勉強しなかったんですか。僕もあまりいい成績はもらいませんでした。//Was it because you didn’t study for it? I didn’t do very well, either.

一生懸命、勉強したんですが、ちょっと風邪をひいていたんです。//I studied as hard as I could, but I caught a bit of a cold.

それはいけませんね。気をつけてください。//That’s too bad [about the cold]. Please do take care.

<br>

#### 成績をつける and 点をつける

/// 成績 {せいせき} “grade” and 点 {てん} “point” are used to express the grade one receives in a course, on a test, etc.

/// The verbs used with these words are つける (for giving a grade) and もらう (for receiving one).

<br>

/// 一生懸命 {いっしょうけんめい} is used with the particle に, though the particle may be deleted in casual conversation.

/// The phrase means that one does something “as hard as one possibly can.”

/// 一所懸命 (i.e., the second kanji pronounced with a short しょ) is also commonly used.

<br>

#### 気をつける

/// There are quite a few idiomatic phrases with the noun 気 {き}, “spirit; mind; heart.”

/// 気をつける indicates that a person pays attention to things, or is careful about certain things.

/// The thing that the topic pays attention to is marked by に.

<br>

車に気をつけてください。//Watch out for cars, please.stage ２，５。

# Stage 2-5 Stems and Their Uses

## 1: Nominal Elements of Stems

### (1) About stems

#### Stem formation

/// To review the rules for deriving stems from base forms, see Stage 1–9.

<br>

#### The polite form as an example

/// See Stage 1–9 for information on the formation of polite forms with stems.

<br>

### (2) Stems as nouns

/// When used alone, a stem may function as a noun, although not all stems can be used as nouns.

/// The following examples are typical:

/// Base form: 話す Stem: 話 {はなし} Meaning as a noun: story; talk

/// Base form: 休む Stem: 休み {やすみ} Meaning as a noun: vacation; time off

/// Base form: 読む Stem: 読み {よみ} Meaning as a noun: reading

<br>

あの先生の話はいつも面白いです。//That teacher’s stories are always interesting.

明日、日本語の授業は休みです。//There will be no Japanese class tomorrow.

この漢字は音読みが二つと訓読みが一つあります。//This kanji has two on-readings and one kun-reading.

<br>

/// Please note that a stem used as a noun is different from a nominalized verb.

/// A nominalized verb with こと or の still maintains a verbal meaning, while a stem used as a noun does not.

/// Compare the following two sentences.

<br>

大学の夏休みは長いですねえ。//The college summer vacation is long, isn’t it?

忙しい時に、時々、休むことは大切です。//It’s important to rest sometimes when things are busy.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Stems used to describe the weather

/// Weather may be described by using nouns such as 雨 {あめ} and 雪 {ゆき}, as shown below:

<br>

今日は雨です。//It is rainy today.

明日は雪です。//It will snow tomorrow.

<br>

/// To describe clear and cloudy days, it is common to use the stems of the relevant verbs in the predicate position.

/// 晴れる {はれる} is a verb meaning “to clear up.” 晴れ {はれ} is the stem of this verb.

<br>

今日は晴れです。//It is sunny today.

<br>

/// Likewise, 曇る {くもる} is a verb that means “to become cloudy.” 曇り {くもり} is the stem of this verb.

<br>

今日は曇りです。//It is cloudy today.

<br>

/// The following formulaic expression is often used by weather forecasters, and may be heard in weather reports.

/// It is good to know this expression in order to understand TV or radio broadcasts, but there is no need to use it to describe the weather in conversation.

/// 後 {のち}, a rather formal word, means “later.”

<br>

今日は、晴れ、後、曇りです。//It will be clear at first and then cloud over later today.

<br>

/// In conversation, 後で {あとで} “at a later time,” with the optional で, may be used rather than 後 {のち}:

<br>

今日は、晴れで、その後（で）、曇りになると聞きました。//I heard that today will be clear at first, and then it will cloud over.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Responding to alternative questions with verbal predicates

/// There are three possible ways to respond to an alternative question:

/// 1. choose one of the options;

/// 2. choose both options;

/// 3. negate both options.

<br>

今日、勉強しましたか、（それとも）仕事しましたか。//Did you study or work today?

<br>

/// When choosing one of the options, state that option, as in the following:

<br>

仕事しました。//I worked.

<br>

/// When choosing both, use the following structure, in which the two nouns are used in the object positions:

<br>

勉強も仕事もしました。//I studied and worked.

<br>

/// If choosing neither option, use the following structure:

<br>

勉強も仕事もしませんでした。//I didn’t study or work.

<br>

/// The verbs in the above alternative question sentence contain the same verb する.

/// The following question sentence, however, contains two different verbs:

<br>

歩きましたか、走りましたか。//Did you walk or run?

<br>

/// In this case, to negate both alternatives, use the stems (which are nouns in form) marked by も with the negative form of the verb する.

<br>

歩きも走りもしませんでした。//I neither walked nor ran.

<br>

/// For choosing or negating both options, the pronoun どちらも “both” or “neither” may be used, regardless of the verbs used in the alternative question.

/// In this case, the verb する represents all verbs.

<br>

どちらもしませんでした。//I neither walked nor ran.

どちらもしました。//I did both.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Stems with に as Purpose Phrases

### (1) Purpose particle に

/// The particle に has many functions, as has already been shown.

/// In the following phrases, に functions to express the purpose of an action:

<br>

朝ご飯にりんごを食べます。//I eat apples for breakfast.

買い物に行きます。//I’m going shopping.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Purpose of going somewhere

/// the stem of a verb is used with the purpose particle に to express a certain action as a purpose.

/// In this construction, the last verb must be a directional verb that indicates a movement from one place to another, such as coming or going somewhere, or returning home.

<br>

映画を見に行きましょう。//Let’s go see a movie.

友達に会いにこのレストランに来ました。//I came to this restaurant to meet my friend.

お昼ご飯をたたべに家に帰りました。//I went home to eat lunch.

<br>

/// When the main verb is not a directional verb, a different construction must be used, as explained in the following section.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Purpose of doing something

/// When the main verb is one that does not indicate direction, such as “studying in order to become a teacher,” or “eating to gain weight,” then the purpose of the action should be expressed by the imperfective form of the verb followed by ために.

<br>

来年、留学するために、今年、日本語を勉強しています。//I am studying Japanese this year in order to study abroad next year.

友達と話すために、電話しました。//I called my friend on the phone in order to talk to him.

<br>

/// In fact, ために can be used for all verb types, even those that indicate direction.

<br>

すしを食べるために町に行きます。//I will go to town to eat sushi.

<br>

/// When both structures are possible, the purpose expressed by ために sounds more serious.

<br>

友達に話しに行きました。//I went to have a chat with my friend.

友達に話すために行きました。//I went to discuss something with my friend.

<br>

/// When the verb preceding ために is in the perfective form, the entire sentence takes on a different meaning.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) 大和言葉 {やまとことば} and 漢語 {かんご}

/// In addition to the use of a stem as a nominal form, one may see an actual noun that consists of kanji compounds in the same construction.

/// As explained thus far, both stems and nominalized verbs function as nominal elements.

/// In addition to these two kinds of nominal elements, there is another group of nouns that consist of more than one kanji.

/// These kanji compounds are called 漢語

<br>

/// For instance, the noun 読書 {どくしょ} “reading,” is a 漢語.

/// The same meaning can be expressed by the verb 読む with the nominalizer こと, as in 読むこと.

<br>

/// In the pair of sentences below, 食べ {たべ} is derived from the verb 食べる, while the noun 食事 {しょくじ} “meal” is expressed with two kanji.

/// This kanji compound is pronounced with the on-reading:

<br>

明日、一緒に食べに行きませんか。//Would you like to eat together tomorrow?

明日、一緒に食事に行きませんか。//Would you like to eat together tomorrow?

<br>

/// In any language, there is often more than one word to refer to the same thing, event, action, state, etc.

/// In English, these similar words, if not exactly the same, may have different origins: AngloSaxon and Latin/French-based, for example.

/// In Japanese, two common sources are native words and Chinese words.

/// The native words are referred to as 大和言葉 or 和語 {わご} while words of Chinese origin are 漢語.

/// For “reading,” 読む is 大和言葉 , while the kanji compound 読書 is of Chinese origin.

<br>

/// Not all 漢語 are of Chinese origin, however.

/// For instance, the verb 食べる is 大和言葉.

/// The 漢語 equivalent is 食事する, but this 漢語 is a Japan-made noun based on the structure of the words of Chinese origin.

/// There are quite a few such 漢語.

<br>

/// Notice the differences in the readings of the kanji of these two words.

/// For most 大和言葉, 訓読み {くんよみ} is used, as in 食べる.

/// And 音読み {おんよみ} is used for most 漢語 as in 食事.

<br>

/// The difference between the two kinds of words is often one of formality.

/// 大和言葉 are used more often in everyday speech, while 漢語 sound somewhat more formal.

/// Of course, this is just a broad generalization, and there are exceptions to this statement.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Emotive Expressions

### (1) Stem with たい

/// the construction of the stem with the suffix ~たい was introduced.

<br>

明日、映画に行きたいです。//I want to go to a movie tomorrow.

<br>

#### Expressing one’s own desires

/// In Japanese culture, it is considered overly direct to express one’s own desires, so it may not be appropriate to use the たい-form by itself in some cases.

/// To avoid such directness, many speakers add the verb 思う {おもう}.

<br>

来年、日本に行きたいと思っています。//I want to go to Japan next year.

<br>

/// Since the above sentence refers to the speaker’s current feeling, 思っている {おもっている} is better than the habitual 思う {おもう}, which is generally used to express the speaker’s opinions.

<br>

/// There is no need to add 思う when negating a desire or talking about a past desire.

<br>

そんな映画は見たくありません。//I don’t want to see that kind of a movie.

ミルクが飲みたかったです。//I wanted to drink milk.

<br>

#### Other facts

/// Other important facts to remember about this construction include the following

/// - The new forms are adjectives, as the last syllable い suggests;

/// - The object should be formally marked by the particle が, but in actual conversation を is also used;

/// - This expression can be used to express the speaker’s desire, or in a question addressing a second person directly, but it may not be used to talk about a third person’s desire.

<br>

#### A third person’s emotive expressions

/// As the last point in the above list states, certain emotive expressions may not be used to describe a third person’s emotive states.

<br>

/// There are many ways to talk about a third person’s desire.

/// One is for the speaker to report what the third person said regarding his or her feelings.

<br>

マイクさんは来年、日本に行きたいと言いました。//Mike-san said that he wanted to go to Japan next year.

<br>

/// Another way is for the speaker to express his or her inference based on direct observation by using a complex predicate with ようだ.

<br>

マイクさんは来年、日本に行きたいようです。//It seems to me that Mike wants to go to Japan next year.

<br>

/// Review and further study of structures with the verbs 言う {いう} (or おっしゃる) and 思う {おもう} follows below.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) The verbs 言う and おっしゃる

/// おっしゃる is the honorific verb of the verb 言う {いう}.

/// The polite form is おっしゃいます, rather than おっしゃります, just as the polite form of いらっしゃる is いらっしゃいます, not いらっしゃります.

<br>

/// Since おっしゃる is the honorific verb of 言う, it is used when the topic is someone to whom the speaker wishes to show respect.

<br>

/// With these verbs, there are essentially two ways to report what the other has said: the speech can be reported directly, or indirectly.

<br>

#### Direct quotation

/// In reporting speech directly, the speaker repeats exactly what another person has said.

/// In the direct quote, such things as the predicate style (polite vs. plain), the predicate ending, and sentence-final particles may also be reported directly.

/// When speaking, it is really up to the speaker to choose what to include in the quote.

/// When reporting in writing, use quotation marks.

/// In horizontal writing, 「 is used to open a quote, and 」 is used to close it.

/// The direction of the quotation marks changes when writing vertically.

<br>

伊藤さんは「このケーキはおいしいですよ。」と言いました。//Ito-san said, ‘You know, this cake is delicious.’

鈴木先生は「試験は金曜日です。」とおっしゃいました。//Suzuki-sensei said, ‘The examination will be on Friday.’

<br>

#### Indirect quotation

/// In an indirect quote, a speaker’s remarks are paraphrased rather than being quoted verbatim.

/// In this case, the content of the quote is expressed in the plain form, even though the person being quoted might have used the polite form.

/// Such things as sentence-final particles are not included in the indirect quote.

<br>

ジョンさんはこのケーキはおいしいと言いました。//John said that this cake was delicious.

<br>

/// With an adjectival predicate, as above, as well as with a verbal predicate, the copula is not needed for an indirect quote.

/// When the predicate is nominal, as below, the copula is needed to indicate aspect:

<br>

伊藤先生は試験は金曜日だとおっしゃいました。//Ito-sensei said that the examination would be on Friday.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) The verb 思う

/// Both 思う {おもう} and 考える {かんがえる} are translated as “to think.”

/// However, 思う, rather than 考える, is used for stating the speaker’s own opinions or thoughts.

/// 考える is usually reserved for the problem-solving type of thinking.

<br>

/// The verb 思う is used similarly to the verb 言う.

/// however, the verb 思う, is not used to quote thoughts directly.

/// Thoughts are generally conveyed by stating their content, rather than the verbatim thoughts themselves.

<br>

/// This verb can be used when the speaker asks the addressee what he or she thinks directly, or when the speaker expresses his or her thoughts.

/// Like other emotive expressions, this verb may not be used to express a third person’s thoughts.

<br>

/// When asking for opinions, use the interrogative pronoun どう rather than 何 {なん}.

<br>

あなたはこれについてどう思いますか。//What do you think of this?

とてもいい考えだと思います。//I think it’s a very good idea.

<br>

/// When asking for specific information, 何 {なん} or 何 {なん} with an appropriate suffix may be used.

/// In this case, the question particle か is not used within the embedded question (that is, the question clause used within the sentence).

/// In the sentence below, か should not be used between the clause 何人だ and the final verb 思う.

<br>

あの人は何人だと思いますか。//What nationality do you think that person is?

あの人は日本人だと思います。//I think he’s Japanese.

<br>

/// As mentioned above, the topic of the verb 思う is always the speaker in a statement sentence, or the addressee in a question sentence.

/// This verb may not be used to report a third person’s opinion. To do this, another element such as 言う {いう} or よう may be used after the verb 思う {おもう}, as shown below.

<br>

鈴木さんはそれはいい考えだと思うと言いました。//Suzuki-san said that he thought it was a good idea.

鈴木さんはそれはいい考えだと思っているようです。//It looks to me like Suzuki-san thinks it’s a good idea.

<br>

### (4) The verb 聞く

/// The verb 聞く {きく} has two different meanings.

<br>

#### 聞く “to hear”

/// It is most common to use indirect quotation to express something that has been heard from another person.

<br>

伊藤先生の授業はとても難しいと聞きました。//I heard that Ito-sensei’s class is very difficult.

伊藤先生の授業はとても難しいということを聞きました。//I heard that Ito-sensei’s class is very difficult.

<br>

/// To convey what has been heard directly, the two verbs, 言う and 聞く, must be used in a single sentence. This type of sentence will be covered in Stage 3–1, as the important factor of direct perception must be considered.

<br>

#### 聞く “to ask”

/// There are direct as well as indirect ways to report the content of a question.

/// When reporting directly, both か in the quoted question and と, which connects the quote and the verb 聞く, are used.

/// When reporting indirectly, the question particle かoverrides the quotative particle と.

<br>

鈴木先生は僕に「何時に起きましたか。」と聞きました。//Suzuki-sensei asked me, ‘What time did you get up?’

鈴木先生は僕に何時に起きたか聞きました。//Suzuki-sensei asked me what time I got up.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Two Simultaneous Events

### (1) Stem with ながら

/// The stem of an action verb with ながら is used as an adverbial phrase to express an action that accompanies a main action, but only as performed by a single person.

<br>

私はいつも新聞を読みながら、勉強します。//I always read the newspaper while I’m studying.

<br>

/// In the sentence above, the main action—studying—is described in the main clause.

/// The other action, reading the newspaper, is the accompanying action.

<br>

/// The main action in the English sentence can be expressed after the word “while” (as in the translated sentence above).

/// In Japanese, the function of the stem with ながら is adverbial, so it must be given before the thing it modifies (the main clause).

<br>

/// Aspects such as negation and time are all expressed in the main clause.

<br>

テレビを見ながら、勉強しないでください。//Please don’t watch TV while you study.

昨日、メールを読みながら、朝ご飯を食べました。//I read my e-mail while I ate breakfast yesterday.

<br>

/// The ながら-construction has the following restrictions:

/// - The ながら-construction may not be used to express an event in which two different people do two different things simultaneously (e.g., “I always read the newspaper while my mother watches TV”).

/// - Neither verb in the ながら-construction can be a stative (non-action) verb (e.g., “I got married while I was in Japan”).

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) The clausal conjunction あいだ（に）

/// Complex sentences joined by the conjunction あいだ（に） may be used in the two situations described above, where the construction with ながら is not possible.

/// The conjunction あいだ may be written in kanji as 間, or in hiragana; both are acceptable.

<br>

/// The construction with あいだ（に） may be used for the actions of a single person or those of two different people.

/// It may also be used to express simultaneous continuous actions, state events, or punctual actions.

/// The use of に is not optional. See the next section for the meaning differences between the sentences with and without に.

<br>

/// In the first example below, that the complex sentence joined by あいだ（に） is used to express events happening with two different people simultaneously.

/// The second example shows that the predicate within the adverbial clause may be stative.

/// It would not be possible to use ながら in either of these cases.

<br>

子供が寝ているあいだ（に）、私は勉強しました。//I studied during the time that my child was sleeping.

私は日本にいるあいだ（に）、漢字をたくさん勉強しました。//I studied a lot of kanji during the time I was in Japan.

<br>

#### The use of に after 間 {あいだ}

/// The particle に in あいだに is not optional.

/// When the particle に is used immediately after 間, it indicates that the duration of the events in the two clauses is not the same.

<br>

子供が寝ている間に、私は勉強しました。//I studied for part of the time that my child was sleeping.

<br>

/// When no に is used, it indicates that the duration of the events in the two clauses is the same.

<br>

子供が寝ている間、私は勉強しました。//I studied while my child was sleeping.

<br>

/// When the action within the main clause is punctual (non-continuous), に is obligatory.

<br>

私は日本にいる間に、彼に会いました。//I met him while I was in Japan.

<br>

#### Predicate forms in the あいだ-clause

/// Because predicate forms in the あいだ-clause are normally durational, the aspect of the adverbial clause does not have to be in the perfective form even for the past events.

<br>

私が病気の間、あの人は手伝ってくださいました。//That person helped me during the time I was sick.

部屋が静かな間に、勉強しました。//I studied while the room was quiet.

子供が寝ているあいだに、勉強しました。//I studied while my child was asleep.

<br>



ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Where does this bus go?

<br>

すみません。このバス、どこ行きですか。//Excuse me. Where does this bus go?

大阪行きです。//To Osaka.

京都行きはどこから出てますか。//Where does the bus to Kyoto leave from?

<br>

#### どこ行き

/// The stem of 行く is used to specify destination in a rather unusual structure.

/// When asking about a destination, it is used within the predicate in a complex noun, どこ行き, with no intervening particle.

/// The stem 行き may be pronounced either いき or ゆき; ゆき is very common in this context.

<br>

### (2) Expressing regret

<br>

ああ、どうしよう？やっぱり、試験、全然、だめだった！//What am I going to do? I knew this would happen . . . I totally messed up my exam!

僕も、あの試験、難しかったと思うよ。//I thought the exam was hard, too.

でも、昨日、私、音楽、聞きながら勉強してたから、私がいけないんだと思う。//But, it’s my fault . . . I listened to music the whole time I was studying yesterday.

<br>

#### どうしよう？

/// This is a casual version of どうしましょうか, “What should I do?” It is important to remember that ど う, rather than なん, is used for this expression.

<br>

#### やっぱり

/// This adverb is used when the speaker wants to express that the situation is what he or she has expected.

/// やっぱり is more casual than やはり.

<br>

#### 私がいけないんです

/// 私がいけない is an idiomatic expression that means “I am the one who should be blamed.”

/// ~んで す expresses that the speaker is trying to convince the addressee that it is his or her fault.

<br>

### (3) A great help

<br>

どうしよう？電車の時間に間に合わないと思います。//What shall I do? I don’t think I can make it to the train in time.

大丈夫ですよ。僕の車で駅まで行きましょう。//It’ll be fine. Let’s go to the station in my car.

ええ？いいんですか。ありがとうございます。本当に助かります。//Really? Are you sure? Thank you so much. What a great help!

<br>

/// 間に合わない is the negative form of the idiomatic phrase, 間に合う {まにあう} “to be on time.”

<br>

#### いいんですか

/// This expression is equivalent to an expression in English, “Are you sure that’s all right?” ~んです か indicates that the speaker wants to confirm his or her assumption or understanding.

<br>

#### 本当に助かります

/// 助かる {たすかる} is an intransitive verb indicating that “something is helpful to the situation that the person is in at the moment.”

/// When someone volunteers to help, this is an appropriate expression to use together with ありがとうございます in two separate sentences.stage ２，６。

# Stage 2-6 Complex Words

<br>

## 1: Complex Adjectives

### (1) What are complex words?

/// Words formed by combining other words are called complex words.

/// A complex word consists of the stem of a predicate joined by another word such as a verb, an adjective, an adverb, or a noun.

<br>

/// Classification of a complex word is based on its final component.

/// For instance, a complex word is an adjective if it consists of the stem of a predicate and an adjective, and a noun if it is formed by the stem of a predicate and a noun.

<br>

/// In this chapter, a variety of complex words will be introduced, including complex adjectives, complex verbs, complex nouns, and complex adjectival nouns.

<br>

### (2) [Stem + やすい(易い)]

/// The stem of a predicate and the adjective やすい together

/// express that the speaker can easily perform the act named by the verb.

<br>

/// The topic of this construction is the thing or the person the speaker describes.

<br>

この漢字は書きやすいですが、その漢字はあまり書きやすくありません。//This kanji is easy to write, but that one is not so easy to write.

この人の書いた手紙は読みやすかったです。//This person’s letters were easy to read.

この新しい外国のペンは書きやすくありませんでした。//The new, foreign pen wasn’t easy to write with.

<br>

/// The following example illustrates how a complex adjective modifies a noun:

<br>

この書きやすいペンはだれのですか。//Who owns this pen that’s so easy to write with?

<br>

/// Non-active verbs are not used in this construction

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) [Stem + にくい(難い)]

/// This construction indicates that the topic poses some kind of difficulty for the speaker.

<br>

この本は分かりにくいです。//This book is hard to understand.

あの先生には本当に話しにくかったです。//That teacher was very difficult to talk to.

<br>

/// The following is an example of using this complex adjective before a noun:

<br>

この分かりにくい本は父が書いた物です。//This hard-to-understand book was written by my father.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Complex Verbs

### (1) [Stem + 過ぎる {すぎる}]

/// This construction is used when the action denoted by the first element is performed in excess.

/// It is also used in excessive or hyperbolic descriptions.

<br>

#### With verbs

<br>

昨日、食べ過ぎました。//I ate too much yesterday.

パーティーで飲みすぎないでください。//Please don’t drink too much at the party.

<br>

#### With adjectives

/// The stems of adjectives are formed by dropping the final い. Use the stem of an adjective and add 過ぎる {すぎる}.

<br>

今日は、私には、寒過ぎます。//It’s too cold for me today.

あの人は頭がよすぎると皆に言われています。//Everyone says that he’s too smart.

<br>

#### With adjectival nouns

/// Adjectival nouns do not have stems since they do not conjugate.

/// In this construction, they come immediately before 過ぎる.

<br>

この部屋は静か過ぎます。//This room is too quiet.

<br>

#### With nouns

/// Some nouns may also be used in this construction, if the noun can imply certain degrees.

<br>

あの学生は子供過ぎます。//That student is too childish.

あの学生は金持ち過ぎて、貧乏な人の気持ちは分からないでしょうね。//That student has too much money, so he probably doesn’t understand how poor people feel.

<br>

#### With negative predicates

/// Although rare, it is possible to use the negative predicate in this construction.

/// All negative predicates contain ない, which follows the same conjugational pattern as adjectives.

/// In this construction, ない with 過ぎる produces なさ過ぎる with さ intervening between the syllable な and すぎる. (This kind of insertion happens when there are too few syllables between two separate elements.)

<br>

うちの子は元気がなさ過ぎます。//Our child is too unwell these days.

ここには頭のいい人がいなさ過ぎます。//There are too few smart people here.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Stem with other verbs

#### 始める -> [Stem + 始める]

/// -> "indicates the beginning of an event"

/// 始める {はじめる} is a transitive verb and meaning “to begin something.”

/// The complex verb formed from this verb indicates the beginning of an event:

<br>

晩ご飯を作り始めましょうか。//Shall we begin making supper?

宿題をし始めました。//I have begun doing my homework.

<br>

#### 出す {だす} -> [Stem + 出す]

/// -> "denotes the beginning of a continuous action or event"

/// Although 出す “to take something out” itself is transitive, it can be combined with both intransitive and transitive verbs.

<br>

/// The verb 思い出す {おもいだす} “to recall”; this verb in fact consists of the stem of the verb 思う {おもう} and the verb 出す {だす}.

/// This complex verb literally means something like “to take out what has been memorized.”

<br>

ああ、あの人の名前を思い出しました。//Oh, now I remember that person’s name.

<br>

/// This expression has an inceptive or inchoative sense, that is, it denotes the beginning of a continuous action or event.

<br>

雨が降り出しました。//It started to rain.

<br>

/// Complex verbs with 出す are very similar to those with 始める {はじめる}.

/// Compare the following two sentences:

<br>

あの人はゆっくり話し出しました。//The person slowly began speaking.

あの人はゆっくり話し始めました。//The person slowly began speaking.

<br>

/// When the speaker anticipates the beginning of an event, 始める may be used; while an unanticipated event may be expressed with 出す.

/// Thus, the first sentence above means that the person began talking and the speaker had not expected it;

/// the second sentence implies that the speech of the person, which the speaker had anticipated, began.

<br>

/// A similar nuance informs the difference in meaning between the following two sentences:

<br>

あの子供は泣き出しました。//The child began to cry.

あの子供は泣き始めました。//The child began to cry.

<br>

/// The first sentence indicates that the child began to cry when no one was expecting it to.

/// But the second sentence makes it sound as if people had been waiting for the child to cry, which could happen, for example, in a dramatic play.

<br>

#### 直す -> [Stem + 直す]

/// -> "an action is repeated"

/// 直す {なおす} by itself means “to correct” or “to repair.” 

<br>

コンピュータを直しました。//I fixed the computer.

<br>

/// When combined with the stem of another verb, the combined meaning implies that an action is repeated.

<br>

この本を読み直しました。//I re-read this book.

手紙を書き直しました。//I re-wrote the letter.

<br>

#### 忘れる -> [Stem + 忘れる]

/// -> "to express forgetting to do something"

/// 忘れる {わすれる} by itself means “to forget.”

<br>

かさを学校に忘れました。//I forgot my umbrella at school.

<br>

/// There are two ways to express forgetting to do something:

/// 1. use the stem of a verb and 忘れる;

/// 2. nominalize the verb with の in the object position (the use of こと rather than の is acceptable, but の is preferable).

<br>

母に電話し忘れました。//I forgot to call my mother.

母に電話するのを忘れました。//I forgot to call my mother.

<br>

/// Although there is only a small difference between the two sentences above, in certain cases the two structures are not interchangeable.

<br>

/// When the action indicated is from one point to a goal (e.g. going, returning, etc.), the use of complex verbs with 忘れる is awkward.

/// In this case, use the nominalized verb with の.

<br>

図書館に行くのを忘れました。//I forgot to go to the library.

今日、歩くのを忘れた。//I forgot to go for a walk today.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Complex Nouns with 方

/// -> [Stem + 方] -> “a way of (doing something).”

/// 方 {かた} means “method” or “way”;

/// thus, the coupling of a verb stem with this noun means “a way of (doing something).”

/// An equivalent expression in English is “how to do something.”

<br>

/// 読み方 “the way of reading” (how to read)

/// 書き方 “the way of writing” (how to write)

/// 食べ方 “the way of eating” (how to eat)

<br>

/// The combined words form a complex noun, so it is important to pay attention to the use of the particle の between the modifying noun and the modified noun.

<br>

今日は、手紙の書き方を習いました。//I learned how to write letters today.

すみませんが、この漢字の読み方を教えて下さいませんか。//Excuse me, but could you tell me how to read this kanji?

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Complex Adjectival Nouns with そう

/// Attaching そう to the stem of a predicate creates an adjectival noun that expresses the speaker’s inference based on his or her direct and immediate observation.

<br>

### (1) With adjectives and adjectival nouns

<br>

あの店のお茶はおいしそうです。//The tea at that shop looks delicious.

ここは静かそうです。//This place feels/looks quiet.

<br>

/// For the adjective いい and the negative ~ない, さ must be inserted between the first syllable and そう.

<br>

この本はよさそうです。//This book looks good

このケーキはおいしくなさそうです。//This cake doesn’t look very tasty.

<br>

### (2) With nouns

/// A noun cannot precede そう, but there is an equivalent word, みたい.

<br>

あの人は日本人みたいです。//That person looks Japanese.

<br>

### (3) As a modifier

/// Because complex words with みたい and そう are adjectival nouns, they must be followed by な when they modify a noun.

<br>

これはおいしそうなケーキですね。//This is a delicious-looking cake, isn’t it?

あの日本人みたいな人はだれですか。//Who is that Japanese-looking person?

<br>

### (4) With Verbs

/// The stem of a verb joined to the suffix ~そう also indicates the immediacy of an observed event.

/// This means that the speaker believes that something will occur very soon, based upon what he or she has observed.

<br>

雨が降りそうです。//It looks like it’s going to rain at any second.

今日は晴れそうですね。//It looks like it’s going to clear up today.

<br>

### (5) Complex words with more than two elements

/// Complex words may consist of more than two elements.

<br>

雨が降り出しそうです。//It looks like it’s going to start raining at any second.

この本は読みやすそうですね。//This book looks like it’s easy to read.

この食べにくそうな食べ物は何ですか。//What is this food that looks like it’s hard to eat?

<br>

#### ~そう and ようだ

/// As explained in earlier chapters, ようだ is used at the end of a sentence to express the speaker’s inference based on his or her observation.

/// The difference between the two is that an expression with ようだ lacks the immediacy of an expression including the stem with ~そう.

<br>

雨が降りそうですね。//It looks like it’s going to rain at any second.

雨が降るようですね。//It looks like it may rain.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Stems Used for Different Speech Levels

/// the honorific system in Japanese is quite complex.

/// the use of honorifics reflects the relation between the topic of a sentence and the speaker,

/// while the use of politeness depends on the relationship between the speaker and the addressee.

<br>

/// Here, a few more facts and the situations of the honorific system will be explained.

<br>

### (1) Inviting and giving instructions

<br>

#### Polite commands and requests

/// -> [~てください and ~てくださいませんか]

<br>

これを日本語で言って下さい。//Please say this in Japanese.

すみませんが、こちらに立たないで下さいませんか。//I’m sorry, but could you please not stand here?

<br>

#### Inviting someone to do something

/// -> [お + Stem + ください]

/// as when inviting a guest to enter the house or to sit somewhere

/// どうぞ is often added to further urge or invite someone to do something.

<br>

どうぞ、お入りください。//Please come (or go) in.

こちらにお座りください。//Please sit here.

<br>

お上がり下さい。//Please come in.

<br>

/// There is no real negative counterpart to the structure above, probably because invitations are generally not given in the negative form.

/// There are many expressions of prohibition, however.

/// Depending on the situation, it is possible to use the negative command or request in certain cases:

<br>

入らないで下さい（ませんか）。//Please do not enter.

<br>

#### Giving instructions to children or students

/// -> [Stem + なさい]

/// Parents or school teachers may use the structure to give instructions or (at times) orders to small children:

<br>

野菜をいっぱい食べなさい。//Eat lots of vegetables.

<br>

/// This structure is also used in examination instructions, in which case the recipients are not only small children.

<br>

次の言葉を漢字で書きなさい。//Write the following words in kanji.

<br>

/// Here, too, there is no exact negative counterpart, but some examples are given below (sentence-final particles used in conversation, such as ね and よ, are used in the following example sentences because they are conversational):

<br>

ここを走らないでね。//Don’t run here.

<br>

/// Alternatively, in spoken Japanese, the following structure with ~てはだめ or ~てはいけません in the predicate may be used:

<br>

ここを走っては、だめですよ。//running here is no good

ここを走っては、いけませんよ。//it won’t do to run here

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Honorific forms

/// For honorific verbs, there are at least three ways (actually, there are more) for the speaker to show his or her respect for the topic of the sentence.

<br>

#### Irregular honorific verbs

/// There are a handful of irregular honorific verbs.

/// The irregular honorific verbs いらっしゃる（いらっしゃ います）, おっしゃる（おっしゃいます）, and くださる（くださいます） have already been introduced.

<br>

ウィリアムズ先生は次の試験は長くないとおっしゃいました。//Williams-sensei said that the next test would not be long.

<br>

#### Formulaic honorific verbs

/// -> [お + Stem + に + なる]

/// Not all verbs have separate honorific verbs. Most honorific verbs are derived from the construction:

<br>

先生はこの本をお読みになりました。//The teacher read this book.

森先生がこの本をお書きになりました。//Mori-sensei is the one who wrote this book.

<br>

#### Passive forms

/// may also be used to express respect, though they are less honorific than the two constructions above.

<br>

先生も明日、行かれますか。//Will you also go tomorrow, Sensei?

先輩はこれをもう読まれましたか。//Have you already read this, Senpai?

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Humble forms

/// Humble verbs, which are a part of the honorific system in Japanese,

/// are used to refer to the speaker’s (or his/her うち-group’s) own action in the presence of someone the speaker respects.

/// Just like honorific verbs, there are irregular and regular humble forms.

<br>

#### Irregular humble verbs

/// There are a handful of humble verbs that are irregular insofar as they are not derived from the base forms of corresponding verbs.

<br>

/// 申す {もうす} is the humble version of the neutral verb 言う {いう};

<br>

私はリンと申します。//I’m Lin.

私はリンと言います。//I’m Lin.

<br>

/// 参る {まいる} is the humble version of the directional verbs 行く {いく} and 来る {くる}.

<br>

私は明日、こちらに参りません。//I won’t come here tomorrow.

私は明日、そちらに参りません。//I won’t go there tomorrow.

<br>

/// Formulaic humble verbs

/// -> [お + Stem + する]

/// Most verbs do not have separate humble verbs. For those verbs, use the construction:

<br>

/// Irregular and formulaic humble verbs are different with respect to when the speaker should use them.

/// Formulaic humble verbs are used only when the speaker does or did something for the person for whom he or she expresses his or her respect.

/// If the action is not done for that person, a formulaic humble verb should not be used.

/// Irregular humble forms do not have this restriction; that is, they may be used for the speaker’s action that is not performed for other people.

<br>

私がお書きします。//I will write it for you.

お読みしましょうか。//Shall I read it for you?

お邪魔します。//Thank you.

<br>

/// ごめんください can be used to announce one’s arrival when visiting people at their home.

/// It is used at the entrance, when the speaker is afraid the host has not noticed that he or she is there.

/// can also be used as a closing phrase when talking on the phone.

<br>

#### いらっしゃい（ませ）

/// The host normally welcomes the guest with this greeting. 

/// ませ makes this expression more polite.

<br>

#### お上がりください

/// the verb 上がる {あがる} literally means “to rise.”

<br>



#### お邪魔します

/// お邪魔します is used often when going into someone else’s house, room, or office.

<br>

あの人、だれ？//Who’s that?

井上さんじゃない？//Isn’t that Inoue-san?

井上さん、何だか、話しにくい人じゃない？//Don’t you think she’s kind of hard to talk to?

ううん・・・そうかな？でも、あの人、とってもかわいそうな人・・・//Huh . . . I guess that’s true, isn’t it? But, you know, I feel really sorry for her.

へえ？そうなの？//Is that right?

<br>

/// 何だか {なんだか}, which means “for some reason,” is used in conversation to express that the reason for a certain thing is not very clear to the speaker.

<br>

#### Rhetorical question with かな

/// かな is used in conversation, when the speaker expresses a question about something without addressing it to anyone but him or herself;

/// the nuance is something like, “I wonder if (such-and-such).”

<br>

/// かわいそう should be regarded as a single word rather than a complex word.

/// The speaker can use this adjectival noun when he or she feels sorry for someone, no matter the reason.

<br>

### (3) For example

<br>

あなたが嫌いな人って、どんな人？//What kind of people get on your nerves?

そうねえ。例えば、話しすぎる人とか、いつも文句を言う人・・・。//Um, let’s see. For example, people who talk too much, or people who complain all the time.

<br>

/// The noun 文句 {もんく} means “complaint.”

/// The associated verb is 言う {いう}, “to say.”

/// The phrase 文句を言う {もんくをいう} therefore means “to complain.”stage ２，７。

# Stage 2-7 Complex Predicates

## 1: Complex Predicates with つもりだ and はずだ

<br>

### (1) What is a complex predicate and what does it do?

/// A complex predicate is a predicate consisting of two or more elements.

/// In Japanese, different elements are added onto the basic predicate to convey the speaker’s view or interpretation of a situation, or his or her intention, among many other things.

<br>

### (2) つもりだ

/// the functional noun つもり and the copula です can be added to a predicate to indicate the speaker’s plan.

<br>

私は来年、日本で勉強するつもりです。//I plan to study in Japan next year.

<br>

/// The negative imperfective form is used in the adjectival clause if the speaker plans not to do something.

<br>

来年、日本で勉強しないつもりです。//My plan is not to study in Japan next year.

<br>

/// It is possible to negate the copula, instead of the verb preceding つもりだ, but this changes the meaning slightly.

/// By negating the copula, the speaker corrects the other person’s positive assumption.

<br>

来年、日本で勉強するつもりじゃありません。//Actually, I don’t plan to go to Japan to study next year.

<br>

#### Restriction on the use of the construction

/// The construction with つもりだ has the same restriction on its use as other emotive expressions; that is,

/// the topic of this construction is the speaker, or the addressee if a question is asked directly.

/// This construction therefore is not used to discuss a third person’s plan or intention.

<br>

カーターさんは、来年、どこで勉強するつもりですか。//Where do you plan to study next year, Carter-san?

私はイギリスで勉強するつもりです。//I plan to study in England.

<br>

/// A third person’s intent may be expressed by reporting what he or she has said, by expressing the speaker’s belief with the verb 思う {おもう}, or by using other complex predicates.

<br>

リンさんは来年、日本で勉強するつもりだと言っていました。//Lin-san said that he plans to study in Japan next year.

ウィリアムズさんは来年、日本で勉強するつもりだと思います。//I believe Williams-san is planning to study in Japan next year.

<br>

### (3) はずだ

/// A complex predicate with はずだ expresses the speaker’s expectation of a certain event;

/// the event need not relate directly to the speaker.

/// Although つもりだ is not used to discuss a third person’s intent, this may be expressed with はずだ.

/// This construction indicates that the speaker is expressing his or her understanding of the third person’s intent.

<br>

カーターさんは来年、日本で勉強するはずです。//It is my understanding that Carter-san will study in Japan next year.

私は来年、日本に行けるはずです。//I believe that I’ll be able to go to Japan next year.

<br>

#### The difference between はず and 思う {おもう}

/// In many sentences, はずだ and 思う can be interchanged, but they each convey a different nuance.

/// 思う expresses the speaker’s personal opinion,

/// but はずだ an objective expectation the speaker infers from some source.

<br>

もうすぐ、先生はいらっしゃるはずです。//I expect the teacher to be here very soon.

もうすぐ、先生はいらっしゃると思います。//I think the teacher will be here soon.

<br>

/// The next pair of sentences illustrate that はずだ expresses the speaker’s belief regarding a certain fact or event, but it may not be used to express a specific personal opinion arising from direct experience.

/// In the latter case, 思う would be used.

<br>

日本語を勉強しているんですか。//Is it true that you’re studying Japanese?

ええ、日本語は難しいですが、本当におもしろい言葉だと思います。//Yes. Japanese is difficult, but I think it’s a very interesting language.

<br>

/// Since the second sentence expresses the speaker’s opinion, はずだ cannot be substituted for 思う

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Complex Predicates with のだ

/// The underlying notion of the use of の (or ん in more casual conversation) and the copula だ in complex predicates gives the sense that the statement or question includes the speaker’s personal interpretation.

/// However, it is easier to learn the meanings this structure can convey when used in statements and questions separately.

<br>

### (1) In questions

/// When の（ん）だ is used with a yes-no question sentence,

/// it indicates that the speaker would like to confirm his or her understanding of a certain situation with the addressee.

<br>

#### Situation 1

<br>

天ぷらが好きなんですか。//I guess you like tempura, don’t you?

<br>

/// Note that な must be used between a nominal element and の（ん）だ.

<br>

#### Situation 2

/// When の（ん）だ is used with an information-seeking question, it indicates that the speaker would like to receive some kind of explanation.

<br>

どこへ行くんですか。//Would you tell me where you’re going?

/// [The speaker seeks an explanation.]

<br>

/// The following question is a straightforward question in which the speaker wants to know where the addressee will go (there is no implication of asking why):

<br>

どこに行きますか。//Where are you going?

<br>

#### Situation 3

/// When the speaker suspects that something unusual has happened to the addressee, he or she can confirm this observation and at the same time convey that he or she would like some kind of explanation from the addressee.

/// The following questions are a few of those that could be used in such a situation:

<br>

何があったんですか。//Tell me, what happened?

何かあったんですか。//Did something happen? – Tell me.

どうしたんですか。//Tell me what happened. Is something wrong?

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) In statements

/// When の（ん）だ is added to the predicate of a statement, it adds the sense that the speaker is giving an explanation of a past or future action.

<br>

/// In the following sentence, the first clause with のだ gives an explanation why the speaker mentions in the main clause that he or she has no money.

<br>

来年、日本に行きたいと思っているのですが、お金がありません。//You may know that I’d like to go to Japan next year, but I don’t have any money.

<br>

/// When asking a professor a question, for example, it is a good idea to explain the reason for asking the question.

/// It is therefore appropriate to use this complex predicate in the first clause:

<br>

来年、日本に行きたいのですが、どの学校がいいでしょうか。//I’d like to go to Japan next year. What school do you think is good?

<br>

/// This complex predicate may also be used both in a why-question and its response in conversation.

<br>

どうして、授業を休んだんですか。//Tell me why you were absent from the class.

頭が痛かったんです。//It was because I had a headache.

<br>

/// the use of ん instead of の is strictly for casual speech.

/// It is therefore not advisable to write ん or use it on more formal occasions.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Complex Predicates with そうだ

/// The complex predicate with そうだ simply conveys information that the speaker has gathered from an outside source (such as TV, radio, newspaper, friends, etc.).

/// The sentence with そうだ is therefore used to objectively report information that the speaker has gathered.

<br>

/// The following example sentences include a verbal, an adjectival, and a nominal (both with an adjectival noun and a noun) predicate before そうだ.

<br>

午後、雨が降るそうです。//My source tells me that it will rain this afternoon.

あの店のお茶はおいしいそうです。//I’ve learned that tea at that shop is delicious.

/// learned or heard/read/

<br>

/// The copula だ needs to be used between a noun or an adjectival noun and そう.

<br>

ここは静かだそうです。//I’ve learned that this place is quiet.

/// learned or heard/read/

あの人は日本人だそうです。//I’ve learned that that person is Japanese.

/// learned or heard/read/

<br>

### (1) Information source

/// The objective source of information in sentences with そうだ may be marked by によると.

<br>

テレビによると、今日は雨が降るそうです。//According to the TV, it’s going to rain today.

林さんの話によると、去年、東京は雪が降ったそうです。//According to Hayashi-san, it snowed in Tokyo last year.

<br>

### (2) Complex predicates with そうだ and quotative sentences with 聞く {きく}

/// These constructions are different in that the means by which the information is conveyed is clearer in the construction with 聞いた {きいた}.

/// The construction with そうだ does not clarify whether the information was “read,” “heard,” or received in some other way, unless he source is identified.

<br>

/// Another difference between these constructions is that the topic of the predicate 聞く is the person who hears the content;

/// however, the topic of the predicate そうだ is not the person who has the information, but the thing or the person that the predicate describes.

<br>

/// In addition, the complex predicate そうだ cannot express the specific time at which the information was obtained, but with the predicate 聞く this is possible.

<br>

午後、雨が降ると聞きました。//I heard that it would rain in the afternoon.

あの人は日本人だと聞きました。//I heard that that person is Japanese.

<br>

家に帰った時に、弟が日本に留学をすると聞いた。//When I went home, I heard that my brother was going to study abroad in Japan.

<br>

### (3) Two different そう

/// Be aware that the complex adjectival noun with そう and the complex predicate with そう（だ） have almost opposite meanings in terms of the information source.

<br>

/// Compare the following two sentences below:

<br>

このケーキはおいしそうですね。//This cake looks delicious!

このケーキはおいしいそうですね。//I hear that this cake is delicious.

<br>

/// The first sentence is uttered based on the speaker’s direct and immediate observation,

/// while the second sentence is based on an outside source, such as hearing from someone else, reading, or some other means.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Conjunctive Forms and Other Verbs

/// There are predicates that consist of two verbs, the first of which is in the conjunctive form.

/// This kind of predicate is quite different from a complex predicate, the biggest distinction being that the speaker’s views are not relevant in these predicates.

<br>

/// Although it is not always the case, the second verb is generally not written in kanji in these predicates.

<br>

### (1) ~てくる (て来る) and ~ていく (て行く)

<br>

#### The verb くる to indicate returning

/// When くる is used after another verb, it indicates that the speaker will return as soon as the event expressed by the first verb is complete.

<br>

コーヒーを買います。//I’ll buy some coffee.

コーヒーを買ってきます。//I’ll go and get some coffee.

<br>

/// The first sentence literally means that the speaker will buy coffee and come back to where he or she was.

/// The second sentence indicates only that the speaker will purchase coffee (no mention is made of coming back):

<br>

走ってきました。//I went running, but I’m back now.

<br>

/// The above sentence indicates that the speaker has returned from running.

<br>

何をしたんですか。//Tell me what you did.

コーヒーを買ったんです。//I bought coffee.

<br>

どこに行ったんですか。//Tell me where you’ve been.

コーヒーを買ってきたんです。//I just went out to get coffee.

<br>

#### Verbs くる and いく to indicate the beginning of an event

/// くる and いく indicate the direction of movement.

/// Since くる describes the topic approaching the speaker, it sometimes expresses the beginning of an event.

<br>

雨が降ってきました。//It’s started raining.

晴れてきました。//It’s beginning to clear up.

曇ってきました。//It’s starting to cloud over.

<br>

/// In the first sentence above, くる conveys the nuance that the rain is coming down on or towards the speaker. いく may not be used here.

/// The second and third sentences convey the nuance that the speaker has directly perceived the changes in the weather.

<br>

/// the combination of the verbs 出る {でる} and いく gives the sense that the topic is moving away from the speaker.

<br>

ルームメートが明日ここから出ていきます。//My roommate is moving away tomorrow.

<br>

#### Metaphorical meanings

/// In addition to their specific meanings,

/// the directional verbs くる and いく can also be used to describe something moving metaphorically towards or away from the speaker.

<br>

/// For instance, if the speaker had trouble understanding something earlier and has finally begun to understand it after much thought, he or she can use this statement:

<br>

分かってきました。//I’m beginning to understand.

<br>

/// The くる in the above sentence indicates that understanding has moved, metaphorically, towards the speaker’s mind.

<br>

日本語を忘れていきます。//I’m starting to forget Japanese.

<br>

/// In the example above, いく indicates that the knowledge the speaker once had is moving away from him or her, metaphorically speaking.

/// くる would not be used in this case.

<br>

### (2) ~ておく

/// The verb 置く {おく}, which means “to place something somewhere,” is used as a regular verb, as in the following example:

<br>

私は鞄を机の上に置きました。//I put my backpack on the desk.

<br>

/// When this verb is combined in a predicate with another verb, it implies that the action will result in a benefit at a later time.

<br>

/// The following sentence literally means, “We will have a party tomorrow, so I bought drinks and food and put them away so that I can use them later at the party.”

<br>

明日、パーティーがありますから、今日、食べ物と飲み物を買っておきました。//We’re having a party tomorrow, so I bought food and drinks for it today.

<br>

/// Here is another example. A teacher might inform her or his students of an upcoming test with the following advice.

/// The full implication is something like, “I will give you a test on Friday, so study the material well and keep it in your memory for the test.”

<br>

金曜日に試験がありますから、よく勉強しておいてください。//We’ll have an exam on Friday, so study the material well.

### (3) Non-fixed use of the ても-adverbials

/// The ても-adverbials may also be used in a non-fixed way.

/// The ても-adverbial expresses a condition that would have been sufficient for the (desirable) expected outcome, but the actual consequence expressed in the main clause indicates that the expected (desired) outcome did not occur.

/// Because of this, the main clause is often in the negative.

<br>

### (4) Interrogative pronoun でも

/// でも is added to interrogative pronouns to produce the following meanings:

<br>

/// なにも nothing,

/// なにか something,

/// なんでも anything

<br>

/// だれも no one,

/// だれか someone,

/// だれでも anyone

<br>

/// どこも nowhere,

/// どちらでも both

<br>

/// （いつも） (always),

/// いつか sometime,

/// いつでも anytime

<br>

/// どうしても no matter how,

/// どうしてか for some reason,

/// どうしてでも by any means

<br>

#### Fixed expression: interrogative pronoun with でもいい（かまわない）

/// Fixed expressions containing an interrogative pronoun with でもいい（かまわない）

/// indicate that any option available would be acceptable.

<br>

パーティーの日は、いつでもいいです。//Any day would do for us to have a party.

一緒に住むのはだれでもいいとは言えません。//I can’t say that I’d be able to live with just anyone.

<br>

#### Non-fixed usages

/// An interrogative pronoun with でも refers to every possible thing, person, and so on, depending on the meaning the interrogative pronoun carries.

/// Such phrases can be used in a non-fixed way.

<br>

あの人は何でも食べます。//That person will eat anything.

あの人に言われたら、どこにでも行きます。//I’ll go anywhere that person tells me to.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: ては-Adverbials

/// Adverbial clauses with ~ては also have both fixed and non-fixed expressions.

<br>

### (1) Expressing prohibition with ~てはいけない or ~てはだめ

/// Both of these fixed expressions indicate that the topicalized element is not acceptable.

/// だめ has a more colloquial tone than いけない.

<br>

この試験では、辞書を使ってはいけません。//You may not use a dictionary for this test.

お客さんに出すお茶は古くてはだめです。//You mustn’t serve old tea to guests.

学生に出す宿題は簡単な宿題ではいけません。//The homework you give to students shouldn’t be easy.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Non-fixed ては-adverbials

<br>

そんなことを言っては、失礼です。//It’s rude to say such a thing.

そんなことを言うのは、失礼です。//Saying such a thing would be rude.

<br>

/// The difference between the two is that the first sentence with ~ては implies that the act of saying has taken place, while the second sentence does not.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Expressing obligation with ~なくては

/// Obligation may be expressed by the following fixed structures: ~なくてはならない, ~なくてはいけない, and ~なくてはだめ.

/// The basic meaning of these phrases comes from the literal meaning, “if (something) did not happen, it would not do.”

/// From this meaning, the nuance of obligation comes through, as in “One must/should do/be such-and-such.”

<br>

/// The difference among the three options is that of formality:

/// the most formal is ~なくてはならない; then ~なくてはいけない; and ~なくてはだめ is colloquial.

/// The following example uses a verbal predicate:

<br>

すぐに行かなくてはだめです。//I’d better go soon.

/// or いけません・なりません

靴は日本製じゃなくてはいけません。//Shoes should be Japan-made.

/// or なりません・だめです

この部屋の机は新しくなくてはなりません。//The desk in this room should be new.

/// or いけません・だめです

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Expressing obligation with ~なければ

/// Obligation may also be expressed by changing the above fixed structure with ~なくては to one with ~なければ and adding the same three options: ~なければはならない, ~なければいけない, and ~なければだめ.

/// The basic meaning of these phrases shares the similar literal meaning as ~なくては: that is, “if (something) did not happen, it would not do.”

/// This meaning is also communicates a sense of obligation, as in “One must/should do/be such-and-such.”

<br>

/// The difference among the three options is, again, formality:

/// the most formal is ~なければならない; then ~なければいけない; and ~なければだめ is colloquial.

<br>

/// For the sake of comparison, the following examples are identical to the ones above except for ~な ければ instead of ~なくては.

/// The examples below use all three predicates (verbal, nominal, and adjectival, in order):

<br>

すぐに行かなければだめです。//I’d better go soon.

/// or いけません・なりません

靴は日本製じゃなければいけません。//Shoes should be Japan-made.

/// or なりません・だめです

この部屋の机は新しくなければなりません。//The desk in this room should be new.

/// or いけません・だめです

<br>

#### The difference between the two expressions of obligation

/// The difference between the two is small.

/// An obligation expressed with ~なければ sounds a little stronger and more formal than one expressed with ~なくては.

<br>

#### Conditionals with ば

/// The fixed expression with ~なければ comes from the conditional predicate form, the ば-form, which will be introduced below.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Conditional Adverbial Clauses with ~ば

/// Thus far, it has been explained that time and situational conditions are expressed with adverbial clauses joined by the conjunctions 時 {とき}, 前 {まえ}, 後 {あと}, or と.

/// The predicate form ~たら may also be used in the adverbial clause in this case.

/// Another adverbial clause that expresses situational conditions is joined by the so-called ば-form of the predicate.

<br>

### (1) Creating the ば-formation

/// Nominal predicate       である → であれば

/// ex 日本人であれば

/// Adjectival predicate    い → ければ

/// ex たかければ, よければ

/// Verbal predicate        the last {u} to {e} and add ば

/// ex たべれば, はなせば, くれば

<br>

#### である as the copula

/// is a more formal copula than だ. 

<br>

姉は医者だ。姉は医者である。//My older sister is a medical doctor.

<br>

/// The ば-form of the copula, であれば, is based only on である and not with だ.

<br>

### (2) Using the ば-conditional

/// The ば-conditional is used only for an assumed situational condition, the realization of which the speaker is not so sure of.

/// That is, the condition stated in the ば-conditional may or may not be true.

<br>

夕食が和食であれば、私は行きません。//If Japanese food is on the menu for dinner, I’m not going.

<br>

/// A similar meaning can also be expressed with the たら-conditional.

/// The “uncertainty” of the condition in the ば-conditional is stronger than that in the たら-conditional, which causes the ば-conditional to sound a little more formal than the たら-conditional.

/// This phenomenon is somewhat universal.

/// In English, as well, it is generally more polite to use the subjunctive mood (see next section) than the indicative (statement) mood: for instance, “should you come this way” is more polite than “if you come this way.”

<br>

/// もし may be used with this type of sentence to emphasize the uncertainty of the condition.

/// もし has no one-word equivalent word in English, but it expresses a notion of something like “there may be a chance of a certain condition” or “if ever (this) should happen.”

<br>

もし、明日、彼が来なければ、大変なことになります。//If by any chance he did not come here tomorrow, it would be tragic.

<br>

### (3) The difference between ~たら and ~ば

/// another difference between the ~たら and the ~ば conditionals has to do with talking about an event that actually happened.

/// the たら-conditional can express an unexpected consequence when the predicate of the main clause is expressed in the perfective form.

/// The main clause is in the perfective form because the event actually did happen.

/// However, the ば-conditional may not be used to talk about an event that really occurred.

/// Since the ば-adverbial indicates only an assumed situation, the main clause is always in the imperfective form.

<br>

家に帰ったら、母が来ていました。//When I went home, I was surprised to find my mother there.

<br>

### (4) Subjunctive use

/// The subjunctive is a way to express a hypothetical situation.

/// For instance, in English, one might say, “If I were you, I wouldn’t have done that.”

/// Obviously, the speaker is not the addressee and never will be; the expression refers to an imaginary situation.

<br>

/// In Japanese, this subjunctive meaning is expressed by the たら-form more often than the ば-form.

/// This is because the syllable ~た of ~たら is the same as the perfective ~た, and an assumed completion of the situation is presented in the adverbial clause.

/// This sort of an assumed completion of the situation may not be expressed by the ば-conditional.

<br>

もし、私があなただったら、そんなことはしていなかっただろう。//If I were you, I wouldn’t have done such a thing.

<br>

### (5) Fixed expressions with the ば-forms

/// The ば-conditional form is used in a few fixed expressions, some of which are introduced below.

<br>

#### どうすれば

/// This construction is used to ask for advice about how best to achieve a certain thing.

<br>

どうすれば、漢字がもっと覚えられるでしょうか。//What’s the best way for me to memorize more kanji?

<br>

/// どうすれば often accompanies いい, as used in the following.

<br>

あの人に連絡できないのですが、どうすればいいと思いますか。//I can’t get in touch with him, so what do you think I should do?

<br>

#### ~ば…ほど

/// Repeating the same verb, once with the ば-conditional and another time with the imperfective form plus ほど, indicates the incremental degree of a description expressed in the independent clause.

<br>

この本は、読めば読むほど、面白くなってきますね。//The more I read this book, the more interesting it gets.

日本語は、勉強すればするほど、難しくなってきます。//The more we study Japanese, the more difficult it becomes.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Adverbial Phrases with として, としても, and としては

### (1) として

/// A noun followed by the particle と and して is a fixed phrase indicating that the noun marked by として is a publicly-recognized category that the topic belongs to.

<br>

加藤先生は日本語の先生として、この大学で教えています。//Kato-sensei teaches at this college as a professor of Japanese.

田中先生は日本語の先生として有名です。//Tanaka-sensei is famous as a Japanese teacher.

<br>

### (2) としても vs. としては

/// として introduced above is also used with は and も, each of which expresses a different nuance.

<br>

/// としては indicates that the attribute of the noun is less than what the speaker expected, while a noun marked with としても is more than expected:

<br>

#### Situation 1

/// Suppose that Williams-san is an American.

/// Americans are generally expected to be taller than Japanese.

/// If the speaker judges that William-san is shorter than a regular American is expected to be, he or she would mark the noun with としては:

<br>

ウィリアムズさんは、アメリカ人としては、背が低いですね。//Williams-san is short for an American.

<br>

#### Situation 2

/// Suppose that Williams-san is an American.

/// The speaker expects Americans to be tall, but Williamssan is even taller than other Americans.

/// In that case, the noun would be marked with としても:

<br>

ウィリアムズさんは、アメリカ人としても、背が高いですね。//Williams-san is tall even for an American.

<br>

そう？だって、何でも食べなきゃ、元気にならないわよ。//Really? But you’re not going to get better unless you eat.

うん。そうだけど。//Yeah, I know, but . . .

<br>

#### お茶でも、飲む？ {おちゃ でも、のむ？}

/// Nouns with でも convey suggested items.

/// So, when offering tea, you can say お茶でも、飲みますか, meaning “Would you like to drink tea or something of that sort?”

<br>

#### 今はちょっと

/// ちょっと is a colloquial expression of 少し {すこし}, but this phrase is used to decline an offer.

/// It means something like “Now is not such a good time.” 

<br>

#### 食べる気しない   {たべる き しない}

/// In this expression, が is deleted from 気しない, and the complete phrase should be 気がしない  {き がしない}.

/// 気しない -> 気がしない

/// The idiom 気がする {きがする} means that the speaker has a certain feeling.

<br>

/// だって is a casual expression that means something similar to でも.

<br>

#### 何でも食べなきゃ  {なん でも たべなきゃ}

/// ~なきゃ, which is very casual, is a contracted form of ~なければ in the construction introduced above.

/// As is the case with other contracted forms, this form is more colloquial than ~なければ.
