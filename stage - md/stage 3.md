# Stage 3-1 Objective vs. Personal Expressions

<br>

## 1: こと and の

### (1) Review of こと and の

/// The following is a summary of points that have already been introduced.

/// One new piece of information is added at the end of this section, namely the use of こと and の in the predicate position.

/// After this review section, additional information on こと and の will be introduced.

<br>

#### こと as a noun and の as a pronoun

/// The following examples show that こと is a noun, while の is a pronoun:

<br>

昨日、山田さんに面白いことを聞きました。//I heard an interesting thing from Yamada-san yesterday.

さっきまであなたのことについて話していました。//We were talking about you until a little while ago.

私が読んだ本はこの本です。あなたが読んだのはどれですか。//This book is the one that I read. Which one did you read?

<br>

#### こと and の as nominalizers

/// Both こと and の function grammatically as nominalizers, and they often can be used interchangeably in such positions as the topic and the object.

<br>

毎日、歩くことは体にとてもいいです。//Walking every day is very good for your health.

/// or 毎日、歩くのは体にとてもいいです。

<br>

僕は人の前で話すのが嫌いです。//I don’t like to speak in front of other people.

/// or 僕は人の前で話すことが嫌いです。

<br>

#### Non-interchangeable こと and の in fixed phrases

/// In many fixed phrases such as with ある and できる, こと and の are not interchangeable.

/// In the following cases, only こと may be used.

<br>

先生を家に招待したことはありませんが、先輩を招待したことが一度、あります。//I have never invited a teacher to my home, but I once invited a senior student.

私は漢字が二千も読むことができます。//I can read as many as two thousand kanji.

<br>

#### Non-interchangeable こと and の in predicates

/// Although the fact has not been introduced up to this point, こと and の are not interchangeable when used as nominalizers in the predicate.

/// In this case, only こと may be used.

<br>

私の趣味は本を読むことです。//My hobby is reading books.

<br>

### (2) The referent of の

/// In some cases, the referent of the pronoun の is not given anywhere in the sentence or discourse.

/// The referent of の, however, is quite apparent from the meaning of a sentence.

/// In the first example, の refers to a place, and in the second, の refers to a person.

<br>

私が生まれたのは東京です。//Tokyo is where I was born.

私が話したのは山田さんです。//The one I spoke to was Yamada-san.

<br>

### (3) こと and の with perception verbs

/// There is a significant difference between こと and の when they are used with verbs of perception.

<br>

私は中田さんがピアノをひいているのを聞きました。//I heard Nakada-san playing the piano.

私は中田さんがピアノをひいていることを聞きました。//I heard that Nakada-san is (or has been) playing the piano (somewhere).

<br>

/// The two sentences are identical except for the use of こと and の.

/// Yet the meaning of each is quite different.

/// In the first sentence, the speaker directly perceived Nakada-san playing the piano in person, so only の is acceptable here.

<br>

/// In the second sentence, in which こと is used, what the speaker heard was the information or report that Nakada-san is (or has been) playing the piano.

/// The speaker did not get a direct perception of Nakada-san’s playing by hearing it in person at all;

/// what she or he heard was the fact that Nakadasan is (or has been) playing the piano. Here only こと may be used.

<br>

上田さんが歩いているのを見ました。//I saw Ueda-san walking.

<br>

/// In this case, こと is unacceptable because the speaker is the one who saw Ueda-san walking.

/// It is not possible to see the information.

<br>

/// In sum, when the main verbs are perceptual verbs such as 聞く {きく} and 見る, こと and の are not interchangeable.

/// こと gives an indirect objective interpretation of an event while の gives a personal and direct one.

<br>

/// When こと and の are interchangeable, as in some of the earlier sentences above,

/// there is a nuance difference, objective vs. personal, between the two sentences.

<br>

### (4) の in complex predicates

/// の（ん in conversation） is used in the predicate to indicate that the statement made in the sentence is the speaker’s explanation.

/// の in the following two examples is the same の as in のだ.

<br>

#### のだろう

/// As explained earlier, だろう, instead of だ, is used when the speaker is not 100% certain that the statement is true.

<br>

この授業はそんなに難しくないでしょう。//This class is probably not that difficult.

<br>

/// When の intervenes between the first predicate and だろう,

/// it indicates that the speaker is giving his or her own interpretation based on first-hand observation.

/// Recall that な must stand between the nominal predicate and の.

<br>

あの女の人は先生なのだろう。//From what I have seen, I think that woman is probably a teacher.

<br>

/// Recall that the speaker is not able to express a third person’s emotion in the predicate directly.

/// When の is used in the predicate, it indicates that the statement is based on the speaker’s observation.

/// Since the use of だろう makes it less certain, the combination is quite appropriate to express a third person’s feelings.

<br>

あの人は犬がこわいのでしょう。//From my observations, it seems like that guy is afraid of dogs.

<br>

/// The following is an example of a verbal predicate.

/// The context of the following statement might be that the speaker has been wondering how Suzuki-san will reach his destination.

/// The speaker might make the following statement based on his or her own observations:

<br>

鈴木さんは自転車で行くのでしょう。//I gather that Suzuki-san will probably go by bicycle.

<br>

#### のかもしれない

/// かもしれない used at the end of a predicate conveys a meaning that is very similar to the structure with だろう discussed above.

/// However, だろう conveys more certainty than かもしれない.

<br>

/// As is the case with だろう, the use of の before かもしれない indicates that the statement is made based on the speaker’s direct observation,

/// and therefore expresses his or her own interpretation of the situation.

/// もしかすると means something like “by chance; there is a chance.” It is used often with かもし れない.

<br>

もしかすると、友達は来週、来るのかもしれません。//Based on my observation, I think there is a chance my friend will come next week.

もしかすると、あの人はこれが見えないのかもしれません。//Based on my observations, I think it’s possible that he is unable to see this.

<br>

## 2: Adverbial Clauses with ので and のに

### (1) Adverbial clauses with ので

/// ので comes from the complex predicate のだ. The で in ので is the conjunctive form of the copula だ.

/// As previously explained, のだ is used in statements to convey the speaker’s personal explanation.

<br>

/// To answer a why-question, it is quite possible to simply respond by using the complex predicate のだ.

<br>

どうして、昨日、授業を休んだのですか。//So, why didn’t you come to class yesterday?

ちょっとお腹が痛かったんです。//Because I had a stomachache.

<br>

/// Although ので is related to のだ, as explained above, it functions as a clausal conjunction to connect the cause-adverbial to its consequence.

<br>

お腹が痛かったので、昨日、授業を休みました。//I didn’t go to class yesterday because I had a stomachache.

<br>

/// So far, three structures that indicate a cause-consequence relation have been introduced.

/// Some differences among the three are discussed below.

<br>

### (2) Differences between から and ので

#### Structural differences between から and ので

/// The only structural difference between から and ので arises when the first clause is a nominal predicate.

/// The plain copula だ must be used before から, while な must be used before ので:

<br>

あの人は日本人だから、日本語を話します。//She speaks Japanese because she is Japanese.

あの人は日本人なので、日本語を話します。//She speaks Japanese because she is Japanese.

<br>

#### Differences in meaning between から and ので

/// ので and から are interchangeable most of the time, especially when the main clause states a factual event.

/// The general difference is that causes expressed with から provide objective reasons, while those with ので offer personal ones.

/// Therefore, even when either one is acceptable, this difference in nuance exists.

<br>

これはあまりおいしくないので、食べませんでした。//This didn’t taste very good, so I didn’t eat it.

これはあまりおいしくないから、食べませんでした。//This didn’t taste very good, so I didn’t eat it.

<br>

#### Cases in which ので should not be used

/// When the main clause expresses such things as requests, commands, suggestions, or invitations, the use of ので can be awkward.

/// Such clauses are better joined by から, which is used in more objective cause-consequence sequences.

<br>

これはあまりおいしくないから、食べないで下さい。//Please don’t eat this, because it doesn’t taste good.

<br>

/// Another situation in which the use of ので is inappropriate is when the copula is used as an abbreviated predicate.

<br>

この大学の学生はなぜ日本語を勉強しませんか。//Why don’t students at this college study Japanese?

日本語の先生がいないからです。//Because they don’t have a Japanese teacher.

<br>

/// ので may not be used in such an abbreviated way.

/// Because the で of ので is the conjunctive form of the copula, another copula may not be used consecutively.

<br>

/// Instead, のです may be used as a complex predicate.

<br>

日本語の先生がいないの（ん）です。//Because there isn’t a Japanese teacher there.

<br>

#### The politeness factor

/// In general, sentences in which ので is used are more polite than those with から.

/// This is because の で implies a sense of a personal accountability for the cause-consequence relation;

/// that is, the speaker takes responsibility for the cause of the consequence.

<br>

#### The cause with ~て

/// When the causal adverbial clause with ~て is used, the consequence expressed in the main clause must be a naturally occurring result, such as emotion or ability.

/// It may not be an intentional act.

<br>

これはおいしくなくて、食べられませんでした。//This didn’t taste very good, so I couldn’t eat it.

<br>

### (3) Adverbial clauses with のに

/// The meaning of the adverbial clause with のに is “despite the fact (given in the dependent clause).”

/// The の of this のに is the same の previously discussed in this chapter; that is, the personal interpretation.

/// The function of のに is quite similar to けれども in the sense that they are both used in adverbial clauses.

/// The similar conjunctions が and でも are not used in complex sentences.

<br>

/// The basic difference between のに and けれども is that のに may not be used when the main clause does not state a factual event.

<br>

/// The の in のに may not be reduced to ん, even for casual speech. (The の in ので, however, may be shortened to ん).

<br>

あの子供はもう随分大きいのに、まだ話せません。//Although that child seems rather big to me, he still can’t talk.

あの人は日本人なのに、着物をぜんぜん着ません。//Although I know that that person is Japanese, she never wears a kimono.

<br>

/// As the following incorrect example demonstrates, のに may not be used when the main clause is a command, request, or suggestion.

<br>

/// In this case, the two clauses may be joined by けれども. See the following:

<br>

寒いけれども、ここに来て下さいませんか。//Even though it’s cold, could you please come over here?

<br>

/// When the main clause expresses an outcome that has already taken place, the sentence is quite acceptable.

<br>

寒いのに、泳ぎに行きました。//Even though it was cold, we went swimming.

<br>

/// When the adverbial clause expresses a condition that is or was inconvenient to others,

/// and the main clause indicates that a task was completed despite this adverse condition,

/// it is better to use のに than the objective けれども.

/// のに indicates that the speaker is aware of the adverse condition.

<br>

北村さんは気分がよくないのに、私を手伝ってくれました。//I knew that Kitamura-san wasn’t feeling well, but she helped me anyway.

<br>

/// When thanking someone for doing something in spite of adverse conditions, this difference should be easy to understand.

<br>

お忙しいのに、来てくださって、本当にありがとうございました。//I know how busy you are, and I do appreciate your coming here despite that.

<br>

## 3: Situation-Focus vs. Person-Focus

### (1) Revisiting verbs する and なる

/// Situation-focused vs. person-focused expressions were introduced with using the verbs する and なる.

/// For instance, announcing a dinner selection may be done in two different ways: する is person-focused, while なる is situation-focused.

<br>

晩ご飯は和食にしました。//We’ve decided to serve Japanese food for dinner.

晩ご飯は和食になりました。//It was decided that the dinner would be Japanese food.

<br>

### (2) ことにする vs. ことになる

/// Earlier in this chapter, it was pointed out that in certain fixed expressions, the nominalizers こと and の are not interchangeable.

/// Nominalizing verbs preceding ~にする and ~になる represent one such case.

/// When a verb is used before する or なる, the nominalizer こと, rather than の, must precede the verb.

<br>

#### When to use which?

/// The implications of person-focused and situation-focused sentences are quite different.

/// In many cases, する is used to report a personal decision made in a certain situation.

/// In such a case, the addressee is probably aware of the options that the speaker had prior to making the decision reported.

<br>

明日、両親に電話することにしました。//I decided that I would call my parents tomorrow.

<br>

/// When なる is used, the speaker is reporting the objective outcome, rather than what the speaker has decided to do in a certain situation.

/// When such a construction as the one below is used, the matter sounds quite significant, because the implication is that it took much thought to arrive at the decision.

<br>

明日、両親に電話することになりました。//It’s been decided that I will call my parents tomorrow.

<br>

/// In some situations, the decision is not solely within the speaker’s control.

/// For instance, a situation such as graduating from school depends on many factors; it is not just a personal decision.

/// If the following statement were made, it would imply that the speaker has earned enough credits to graduate and that he or she has the option of when to graduate (not a common situation).

<br>

この六月に卒業することにしました。//I decided to graduate this June.

<br>

/// When publicly announcing a graduation (such as in an invitation card for a graduation party), the following expression with なる is much more appropriate.

/// Even though the speaker has not graduated yet, the main verb must be in the perfective aspect.

/// The perfective aspect here indicates that the decision has already been made about the coming commencement.

<br>

この六月に卒業することになりました。//I will be graduating this June.

<br>

#### Culturally speaking

/// Though it is largely situational, it is generally more appropriate to use なる when making a public announcement (e.g. wedding, graduation, starting school, starting a new job, etc.).

/// For personal matters, day-to-day decisions are more likely to be expressed with する (food, shopping, assignment, etc.).

/// When なる is used for daily decisions, it indicates that the decision is not a trivial one.

<br>

### (3) Revisiting transitive-intransitive verb pairs

/// As explained in earlier chapters, a few hundred transitive-intransitive pairs of verbs exist in Japanese.

/// In general, the transitive verbs of these pairs are used for person-focused expressions, while intransitives are situation-focused.

<br>

/// Depending on the situation, it may be more appropriate to use a transitive verb in some cases.

/// In other cases, the reverse is true.

/// The main point is that “who” did something can be expressed only via the use of transitive verbs.

<br>

/// If the speaker broke an important item—say, a cell phone–that his or her roommate treasured, how would he or she apologize for the mistake?

/// Using an intransitive verb would imply that the cell phone broke for an unfortunate reason (e.g. wind blew it off the table; a cat walked near it and knocked it off the table).

/// But when a transitive verb is used, it makes it obvious that the speaker did something like dropping it by mistake.

/// Therefore, the first example below would be more appropriate than the second.  ( 壊す {こわす} is transitive, while 壊れる {こわれる} is intransitive).

<br>

大切な携帯を壊してしまって、本当にごめんなさい。//I am so sorry I broke your precious cell phone.

<br>

/// In trying to comfort the person who is feeling bad about breaking the phone, one might make the following statement, using an intransitive verb:

<br>

携帯はよく壊れるから、私は何とも思っていませんよ。心配しないでください。//Cell phones break all the time, so I don’t think anything of it. Please don’t worry about it.

<br>

/// Imagine how the following inappropriate sentence using a transitive verb might sound to the addressee:

<br>

### (4) Transitive て-forms with ある (situation-focused)

/// The use of transitive verbs is by nature person-focused, because the verb implies that the topic operates on the object.

/// Transitive verbs can, however, be used for situation-focused expressions as well, with the following construction:

<br>

戸が開けてあります。//The door has been opened.

<br>

/// The construction above contains the conjunctive form of a transitive verb and ある.

/// Not all transitive verbs may be used in the above construction; it is limited to those transitive verbs that leave some kind of trace of the result of completing the action implied by the verb.

/// In the above sentence, someone opened the door (transitive act; person-focused) and the door is left standing open (situation-focused).

/// Even though the sentence implies that someone opened the door, it is not possible to articulate the person in this kind of construction.

<br>

/// Compare the following.

/// Although the verbs 書く and 飲む are both transitive, the てある-construction is acceptable with 書く, but not with 飲む.

/// This is because a name can be traced after someone has written it, but water cannot be traced after it is consumed.

<br>

ここに名前が書いてあります。//The name is written here.

<br>

## 4: なら-Adverbial as a Situational Condition

/// A number of conditional adverbial clauses have been introduced so far (e.g., clauses joined by とき, と, ~たら, ~ば);

/// each of these gives a distinct meaning to the preceding clause and connects it to the main clause.

/// It would be wise to review these clauses at this point to ensure that everything introduced has been clearly understood.

<br>

/// The most salient meaning of the なら-adverbial, as distinct from all the other conditionals,

/// is that the condition expressed in the なら-clause is how the speaker interprets a situation in the context of the speaker’s earlier deeds or statements (whether verbalized or assumed).

/// The speaker’s interpretation is offered as a possible condition for the consequence expressed in the main clause.

<br>

/// What this means is that the なら-conditional clause has a certain reference point (i.e., the previous statement, thought, etc.).

/// This is not true for other conditional clauses.

<br>

/// The なら-conditional clause is similar in nuance to the たら-conditional clause with the complex predicate with のだ.

<br>

あなたが行くのだったら、私は行きません。//If I understand that you are going to go, I will not go.

あなたが行くなら、私は行きません。//If it seems to me that you are going to go, I will not go.

<br>

/// の may be inserted between the clause and なら, emphasizing the speaker’s interpretation of the situation:

<br>

あなたが行くのなら、私は行きません。//I take it that you may go, and if that is in fact the case, I will not go.

あの授業がそんなに難しいのなら、辞めたらどうですか。//If the class is that difficult, why don’t you quit?

<br>

/// It is not incorrect to insert の with the nominal predicate, as seen below.

/// However, this is a rather awkward structure because there are too many clusters of elements that indicate the speaker’s personal interpretation.

/// Without の, the personal account is well expressed:

<br>

あの人が日本人なら、この仕事をあの人に頼みましょうか。//If that person is indeed Japanese, shall we ask her to do this job?

<br>



ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) He got upset again!

<br>

山田君、どこ？//Where is Yamada-kun?

ええ？山田君なら、もう帰っちゃいましたよ。//What? If you’re asking about Yamada-kun, he already went home.

ええ？もう、帰った？//He went home already?

ええ。また、怒ったんでしょ、きっと。//Yeah. I’m sure he got upset again!

<br>

#### ええ？

/// With a rising tone, this vocalization indicates that the speaker is quite surprised.

/// Greater surprise is expressed with a more drawn-out pronunciation.

<br>

#### A short でしょ

/// If she or he is upset, a speaker may cut でしょう rather short, following it immediately with the next word.

/// However, not every short でしょ indicates that the speaker is upset.

<br>

#### Word order inversion

/// The last line shows an inversion of the predicate and an adverb, きっと “surely.”

/// This kind of inversion occurs in conversation.

/// The last word is added as an afterthought, or to show that the speaker wants to emphasize the word.

<br>

### (2) A quick errand

<br>

ちょっと、お腹、すいたんで、出てきます。//I’m a little hungry, so I’m going to go out for a moment.

どこ、行くの？//Where are you going?

コンビニ、行ってきます。//Just to the mini-mart.

コンビニかあ。僕も行こうかな？//Mini mart . . . hmm . . . I think I’ll go, too.

<br>

#### んで for causes

/// ので may be shortened to んで in conversation.

<br>

#### コンビニかあ

/// The vowel in the question particle か may be prolonged while trying to come up with things to say.

<br>

### (3) Declining an offer politely

<br>

もう少し、いかがですか。//How about a little more?

ありがとうございます。これで十分です。//Thank you, but I’ve had plenty.

そうですか・・・でも、少しだけなら、大丈夫でしょう？//Really? But you can have just a bit more, can’t you?

いいえ、本当にもう結構です。//No, really, I’m fine.

<br>

#### これで十分です  {これでじゅうぶんです}

/// It is quite common for a Japanese host to offer things like food and drink repeatedly, even if the guest declines the offer.

/// This phrase, and もう結構です  {もうけっこうです} below, are typical ways to politely decline an offer.

<br>

/// 十分 {じゅうぶん} is an adjectival noun that means “sufficient; enough.”

/// これで十分です means “this is sufficient.”

/// で in this case indicates a boundary delimiting the amount that the speaker has.

<br>

#### もう結構です

/// This is another polite way to decline an offer.

/// The adjectival noun 結構 {けっこう} means “great; fine; excellent.”

/// With もう, the phrase means something like, “I’m fine with the way things are right now.”

/// The phrase 結構です may be used either for praising something or declining an offer, depending on the situation.

<br>

### (4) It’s my fault

<br>

どうしたんですか。何かあったんですか。//What’s wrong? Did something happen?

うん、ちょっと。日本語の試験の成績、本当にひどかったんです。//Yeah, kinda . . . I got an awful grade on my Japanese test.

試験、難しかったんじゃないですか。//Well, it was a hard test, wasn’t it?

そうじゃないんです。僕がいけないんです。勉強しなかったんです。//It wasn’t that. It’s my fault. I just didn’t study.

<br>

#### Giving a vague answer うん、ちょっと

/// うん、ちょっと is a way to give a vague answer to a question, especially if the speaker is put into a situation where he or she needs to explain something personal.stage ３，２。

# Stage 3-2 Making Inferences

## 1: Complex Predicates with そうだ

### (1) Overview

/// Complex predicates with such elements as そうだ, ようだ, and らしい express the speaker’s inferences based on different sources.

/// Some of these have been already introduced, and some are new.

<br>

/// The difference among the structures that express inferences lies in the source of information:

/// whether it is from an objective or subjective source, or the degree of objectivity or subjectivity of the information source.

<br>

/// The following illustrates the continuum of different information sources of the relevant elements of these structures.

<br>

/// Objective source ———————-———————— Subjective source

/// そうだ らしい                      ようだ Stem + そう

<br>

/// Often, English expressions such as “it appears,” “it looks,” “it seems,” or “it is likely” are used to introduce complex predicate structures with the above elements.

/// A reminder here is that there is no absolute one-to-one correspondence between certain English translations and Japanese sentences (or vice versa),

/// so it is important to remember that learning the underlying meaning of each structure is far more powerful than learning structures via English translation.

<br>

### (2) Complex words with そう and complex predicates with そうだ

/// They look similar, but the information sources, as well as the structures, are quite different. Review the following.

<br>

/// A complex adjectival noun is derived by adding そう to the stem of a word, while a complex predicate is derived by adding そうだ to the original predicate.

/// The meanings are quite different.

<br>

あの人の作ったケーキはまずそうですね。//The cake that he made doesn’t look very appetizing, does it?

あの人の作ったケーキはまずいそうですね。//I heard that the cake that he made is unappetizing; is that right?

<br>

#### Information source

/// the objective information source is often expressed with によると and a complex predicate with そうだ.

/// However, the objective source cannot be expressed by the complex adjectival noun with そう.

/// This complex word is used only for information sources that are completely subjective.

<br>

山田さんの話によると、あの人の作ったケーキはまずいそうですね。//According to Yamada-san, the cake that he made is unappetizing, but is that really so?

<br>

### (3) Aspects of the two structures

/// The following sentences illustrate how aspects of the above two structures are expressed:

<br>

#### Negative sentences containing complex words with そう

/// There are two ways to negate a sentence containing a complex adjectival noun with そう.

/// The first is to use the negative of the original word and add そう. Recall that さ must be inserted between the negative な~ and そう.

/// This is true with all negatives and the positive adjective いい, which is よさそう.

<br>

雨が降らなさそうです。//It looks to me like it’s not going to rain any time soon.

<br>

/// The second way is to form a complex adjectival noun first and then negate the predicate.

<br>

雨が降りそうじゃありません。//It doesn’t look to me like it’s going to rain any time soon.

<br>

/// There is a difference in meaning between the two negative sentences above:

/// the first sentence above expresses the speaker’s own observation that it might not rain

/// while the second sentence is the speaker’s negation of a previous statement or inference (which could include the speaker’s own inference prior to the observation).

<br>

#### Positive and negative perfective sentences containing complex words with そう

/// The positive perfective is indicated by the predicate; this is the only way to express this aspect.

/// In other words, it is not possible to put the original word into the perfective form before adding そう in this structure.

<br>

雨が降りそうでした。//It looked to me like it was going to rain soon.

<br>

/// There are two ways to form negative perfective sentences with complex adjectival nouns with そう.

/// These are the same as the ways of forming imperfective negative sentences; the only difference is that でした is added.

/// The difference in nuance between the two is the same as for negative imperfectives.

<br>

雨が降らなさそうでした。//It looked to me like it wasn’t going to rain any time soon.

雨が降りそうじゃありませんでした。//It didn’t look to me like it was going to rain any time soon.

<br>

#### Indicating aspect in complex predicates with そうだ

/// Because そうだ at the end of a complex predicate does not convey when the information was obtained, aspect cannot be expressed by this element.

/// In constructions including the complex predicate with そうだ, the most natural way to indicate aspect is therefore to express it in the first predicate within the complex predicate.

<br>

午後は雨が降らないそうです。//I heard that it’s not going to rain in the afternoon.

午後は雨が降ったそうです。//I heard that it rained in the afternoon.

午後は雨が降らなかったそうです。//I heard that it didn’t rain this afternoon.

今は日本でも雨が降っているそうです。//I heard that it’s raining in Japan now, too.

<br>

## 2: Complex Predicates with ようだ

/// Complex predicates with ようだ were mentioned in Stages 1–7 and 2–5, but the ways in which this structure is used have not been covered.

/// In fact, よう is used in quite a few ways in various structures.

<br>

### (1) The use of よう in complex predicates

/// The word よう literally means “appearance.” The use of よう in the complex predicate therefore indicates that the event that the sentence refers to is based on an inference drawn from the speaker’s direct perception of a situation.

/// The information may be from an objective source as well, but the speaker must still confirm it through his or her own direct observation.

<br>

#### Predicates before ようだ

/// The following examples illustrate the use of all three predicates before ようだ.

<br>

午後、雨が降るようです。//It looks like it will rain this afternoon.

あの店のお茶はおいしいようです。//The tea at that shop looks delicious.

ここは静かなようです。//It seems like this place is quiet.

あの人は日本人のようです。//That person looks Japanese.

<br>

/// In the following section, different aspects of this construction are presented.

/// The same content, that is, “rain in the afternoon,” will be used in all cases so that the comparison will be clearer.

<br>

#### Negative aspects

/// A structure in which the predicate before ようだ is negative is different in meaning from one in which ようだ itself is negative.

<br>

/// When the predicate before ようだ is negative, the speaker is stating her or his observation.

<br>

午後、雨が降らないようです。//It looks like it won’t rain this afternoon.

<br>

/// When ようだ is negative, the speaker is negating the assumption that it may rain.

<br>

午後、雨が降るようではありません。//It doesn’t look like it will rain this afternoon.

<br>

#### Positive perfective aspect

/// Structures that use the perfective in the predicate before ようだ are different in meaning from those that use ようだ in the perfective.

<br>

/// When the positive aspect is expressed in the predicate before ようだ, the speaker is informing the addressee that he or she believes that it rained in the afternoon.

<br>

午後、雨が降ったようです。//It looks like it rained in the afternoon.

<br>

/// When ようだ is in the perfective, it refers to a certain past situation in which the speaker reports that it looked as if it would rain in the afternoon.

/// For instance, if the speaker is talking about the previous weekend, by using this structure, she or he is saying that it looked like rain then.

<br>

午後、雨が降るようでした。//It looked like it was going to rain in the afternoon.

<br>

/// The following illustrates when both predicates are positive perfective.

<br>

午後、雨が降ったようでした。//It looked like it had rained in the afternoon.

<br>

#### Negative perfective aspect

/// With this aspect, the difference in meaning depends on the place of negation.

/// The difference is similar to the difference between negative imperfectives.

<br>

午後、雨が降らなかったようです。//It looks like it didn’t rain in the afternoon.

午後、雨が降るようじゃありませんでした。//It didn’t look like it would rain in the afternoon.

<br>

/// When referring to a situation in the past, the following structures are possible.

/// The first sentence indicates that the speaker observed in the past that it would not rain, while the second one conveys the speaker’s past observation that it did not rain.

<br>

午後、雨が降らないようでした。//It looked like it wouldn’t rain in the afternoon.

午後、雨が降らなかったようでした。//It looked like it hadn’t rained in the afternoon.

<br>

### (2) Complex words with そう and complex predicates with ようだ

/// For both structures—complex adjectival nouns with そう and complex predicates with ようだ—the information source is subjective.

<br>

#### Time of events

/// Despite this similarity, there are some important differences.

/// The sentence with the complex adjectival noun conveys “immediacy”—something like “it looks as if the rain will come very soon.”

/// It also expresses the speaker’s strong prediction if immediacy is not included.

/// With complex predicates containing ようだ, these implications are not conveyed.

<br>

雨が降りそうです。//It looks like it’s going to rain any minute now.

明日も雨が降るようです。//It looks like it’s going to rain tomorrow, too.

<br>

/// Compare the following examples.

<br>

このすしは本当においしそうですねえ。//This sushi looks really delicious!

あそこのすしは本当においしいようですねえ。//Sushi at that restaurant is supposed to be quite good.

<br>

/// The first sentence with the complex word with そう is used when something—sushi, in this case— is right in front of the speaker.

/// The second sentence containing the complex predicate with ようだ is an inference made by the speaker based on what he or she has heard or witnessed.

<br>

#### Information source

/// Though complex adjectival nouns with そう and complex predicates with ようだ are based on a subjective information source, the latter may also include an objective source.

<br>

/// Because complex predicates with ようだ may contain combined information sources, an objective source may be expressed with this construction.

/// This is not possible, however, with the complex adjectival noun with そう.

<br>

テレビによると、午後、雨が降るようです。//According to the TV, it’s supposed to rain in the afternoon.

<br>

#### A conversational function of ようだ

/// When the speaker wishes to make an assertion, she or he may choose to add ようだ at the end of sentence to soften the assertion.

/// For instance, the use of ようだ adds the nuance that the speaker agrees with something based on his or her own direct observation.

<br>

/// For instance, the following examples show that the one with 思います is much stronger than そのよ うです when expressing agreement.

<br>

あの人は困っているようですね。//She is in trouble, isn’t she?

そう思います。//I think so.

そのようですね。//It seems that way, doesn’t it?

<br>

#### Emotive expressions with ようだ

/// Similar to the way in which a third person’s emotions may be reported with 言う and 思う, the use of ようだ is also appropriate when the speaker has witnessed a third person’s emotions directly. 

<br>

### (3) みたいだ and ようだ

/// Though more colloquial in tone, complex predicates with みたいだ express the same degree of subjectivity and objectivity with regard to the information source as those with ようだ.

/// The following examples illustrate that there is no structural difference between sentences with みたい and ようだ when the predicate is verbal or adjectival.

/// There is, however, a structural difference when the predicate is nominal.

<br>

午後、雨が降るようです。//It looks like it’s going to rain this afternoon.

午後、雨が降るみたいです。//It looks like it’s going to rain this afternoon.

<br>

あの店のお茶はおいしいようです。//The tea at that shop looks delicious.

あの店のお茶はおいしいみたいです。//The tea at that shop looks delicious.

<br>

ここは静かなようです。//This place seems quiet.

ここは静かみたいです。//This place seems quiet.

<br>

あの人は日本人のようです。//That person looks Japanese.

あの人は日本人みたいです。//That person looks Japanese.

<br>

## 3: Different Uses of よう

/// The following sections discuss uses of よう other than ようだ in complex predicates.

<br>

### (1) Adjectival and adverbial phrases with よう and みたい

#### Similes with よう and みたい

/// Similes may be expressed with よう or みたい. な is needed to join either word to the noun that follows.

/// Though it is not necessary to use の between みたい and the preceding noun, の is necessary for よう.

<br>

あの人は先生のような人ですね。//That person acts like a teacher, doesn’t he?

あの人は先生みたいな人ですね。//That person acts like a teacher, doesn’t he?

<br>

あのコーヒーのような飲み物は何ですか。//What is that coffee-like drink?

あのコーヒーみたいな飲み物は何ですか。//What is that coffee-like drink?

<br>

#### よう and みたい representing a category

<br>

/// The noun followed by よう or みたい represents a category.

<br>

北川さんのような人は嫌いです。//I can’t stand people like Kitagawa-san.

北川さんみたいな人は嫌いです。//I can’t stand people like Kitagawa-san.

<br>

和食のような物を作りました。//I made something that looks like Japanese food.

和食みたいな物を作りました。//I made something that looks like Japanese food.

<br>

#### Adverbial similes with よう and みたい

/// Similes may be expressed adverbially using よう or みたい. In this case, に must be used to make the よう-phrase an adverbial one.

/// ぶた in the third and fourth examples means “pig.”

<br>

あの学生は日本人のように日本語を話しますね。//That student speaks Japanese just like a native, doesn’t she?

あの学生は日本人みたいに日本語を話しますね。//That student speaks Japanese just like a native, doesn’t she?

<br>

昨日、ぶたのようにたくさん食べました。//I ate like a pig yesterday.

昨日、ぶたみたいにたくさん食べました。//I ate like a pig yesterday.

<br>

#### まるで・・・よう（な・に） or みたい（な・に）

/// The adverb まるで may be added in the sentences above to emphasize the degree of similarity of the things being compared.

<br>

あのアメリカ人はまるで日本人のようなアメリカ人ですね。//That American is just like a Japanese person.

あのアメリカ人はまるで日本人みたいなアメリカ人ですね。//That American is just like a Japanese person.

<br>

昨日、まるでぶたのようにたくさん食べました。//I ate so much yesterday, like an absolute pig.

昨日、まるでぶたみたいにたくさん食べました。//I ate so much yesterday, like an absolute pig.

<br>

### (2) ように expressing a goal

/// A target or a goal may be expressed with ように.

/// In this case, the predicate before ように must be imperfective.

<br>

試験に合格するように毎日、一生懸命に勉強しています。//I’ve been studying hard every day so I can pass the examination.

あまり太らないように毎日、運動しています。//I’ve been exercising every day so I won’t get fat.

<br>

### (3) ようにする expressing effort

/// In this construction, the verb, whether positive or negative, must be in the imperfective form.

/// This structure indicates that the speaker is making an effort to do or not do something.

<br>

もっと勉強するようにします。//I will try to study more.

<br>

/// Adverbs such as なるべく “as much as possible” often accompany this structure.

/// The following sentence illustrates the negative aspect as well.

<br>

なるべく遊ばないようにします。//I will make an effort to play as little as possible.

<br>

/// The adverbial phrase できるだけ “as much as possible” is more colloquial than なるべく used above.

/// The following sentence illustrates the negative perfective aspect:

<br>

できるだけ、あの人とは話さないようにしました。//I tried to speak to that person as little as possible.

<br>

#### ようになる

/// Since the expressions above convey that the speaker is making an effort, they are person-focused expressions.

/// Compare them to the following sentences with ようになる, which are all situation-focused.

/// It may be helpful to remember that the verb なる is used to indicate situational changes.

<br>

あの人とあまり遊ばないようになりました。//Things have changed, and I don’t play with him anymore.

あの人とは話さないようになりました。//As things stand now, I no longer speak to him.

<br>

#### ようにする and ~てみる

/// The sentences with ようにする introduced above, especially the positive ones, may seem similar to structures with ~てみる, primarily because both structures are commonly expressed with the English verb “try.”

/// However, while the expression with ~てみる focuses on the result of the action of studying,

/// the structure ようにする focuses on the effort to do the studying, and the actual action of studying has not taken place.

<br>

もっと勉強してみます。//I will try studying more.

/// Literally, “I will see how it turns out after studying more.”

<br>

もっと勉強するようにします。//I will try to study more.

/// Literally, “I will make an effort to study more.”

<br>

### (4) Volitional とする

/// Yet another structure exists that is similar to the two structures above.

/// When the volitional form is used with the particle と and the verb する, usually in its perfective form, the combination indicates that the speaker made an effort to do something, but the action was not successfully carried out as a result.

/// In these sentences, the implication is that the speaker was never able to carry out the act expressed in the adverbial clauses.

<br>

晩ご飯を食べようとしましたが、食べられませんでした。//I tried to eat my dinner, but I couldn’t do it.

電話をしようとしましたが、時間がありませんでした。//I meant to call you last night, but I didn’t have time.

<br>

#### Differences in sentences with ようにする, volitional とする（した）, and てみる

/// Compare the following three structures.

/// Although it is possible for all three of the sentences below to be expressed with the English verb “try,” students should be mindful of the underlying meaning of each Japanese sentence.

<br>

野菜を食べるようにしました。//I tried to eat the vegetables.

/// Literally, “I made an effort to eat the vegetables.”

<br>

野菜を食べようとしました。//I tried to eat the vegetables.

/// Literally, “I was about to eat the vegetables, but was unable to.”

<br>

野菜を食べてみました。//I tried eating the vegetables.

/// Literally, “I ate the vegetables and saw how they were.

<br>

## 4: Complex Predicates with らしい

/// Complex predicates with らしい are closest in meaning to those with そうだ.

/// Both structures imply that the information source is an objective one.

/// Structures with そうだ, however, merely report the information; no confirmation of the information by the speaker is implied.

/// With らしい, this confirmation is expressed.

<br>

### (1) Structures with らしい

/// As with complex predicates with そうだ, aspect is not reflected in the predicate with らしい.

/// Instead, all aspectual forms are included in the predicate before らしい.

/// The following examples show various types of predicates and different aspects.

<br>

午後、雨が降るらしいです。//It seems like it’s going to rain this afternoon.

午後、雨は降らないらしいです。//It seems like it’s not going to rain this afternoon.

あの店のお茶はおいしいらしいです。//It seems like tea at that shop is delicious.

あの店のお茶はおいしかったらしいです。//It seems like tea at that shop was delicious.

ここは静からしいです。//It seems like this place is quiet.

ここは静かじゃなかったらしいです。//It seems that the place wasn’t quiet.

あの人は日本人らしいです。//It seems like that person is Japanese.

あの人は日本人じゃないらしいです。//It seems like that person is not Japanese.

<br>

### (2) Complex adjectives with らしい

/// らしい is also used to form complex adjectives.

<br>

/// In the following example, 日本人らしい is a complex adjective conveying that the topic satisfies every criterion of what a Japanese person ought to be.

<br>

あの女の人は日本人らしいですねえ。//That woman acts very Japanese, doesn’t she?

<br>

/// When written, there is no difference between the forms of a complex adjective with らしい and a complex predicate with らしい.

/// Only the context in which a sentence is used will indicate whether it is used as a complex predicate or a complex adjective.

<br>

あの女の人は日本人らしいですねえ。//That woman seems to be a Japanese, doesn’t she?

<br>

/// In speaking, there is a difference in pause and pitches between the complex adjective and the complex predicate.

/// Since the complex adjective is an independent word, there is no pause in pronunciation between 日本人and らしい.

/// Therefore, the pitch used between 日本人and らしい is continuous.

/// When らしい is in the predicate, there should be a break or pause in pronunciation between 日本人 and らしい, even if it is a very brief pause.

<br>

/// The following sentence illustrates how the complex adjective with らしい modifies a noun.

/// Here, あの人 is a teacher who speaks as one would expect a teacher to do.

<br>

あの人は先生らしい話し方をしますね。//That person speaks in a very teacher-like manner.

<br>

/// Compare the following sentence with the one above.

/// Here, あの人 is not a teacher, or the speaker is not certain if あの人 is a teacher but she speaks as if she were one.

<br>

あの人は先生のような話し方をしますね。//That person talks like a teacher.

<br>

### (3) Adverbs with らしく

/// Complex adjectives with らしい are used as adverbs by changing the final い to く.

<br>

あの人はいつもとても女性らしく話します。//The way she speaks is always very feminine.

大学内では学生らしく行動してください。//Please behave the way a student should on campus.

<br>

### (4) Comparison of the four structures

/// The differences in the four structures are compared in the following chart:

<br>

#### そうだ

/// Source of information -> Objective: Entirely, Subjective: Not at all

/// Features -> Reporting objectively, No confirmation

<br>

#### らしい

/// Source of information -> Objective: Mostly, Subjective: A little

/// Features -> Reporting objectively, Confirmation by the speaker

<br>

#### ようだ

/// Source of information -> Objective: A little, Subjective: Mostly

/// Features -> Inference based on the speaker’s direct observation

<br>

#### Stem + そう

/// Source of information -> Objective: Not at all, Subjective: Entirely

/// Features -> Inference based on the speaker’s direct observation Immediacy

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

<br>

### (1) It seems that way

<br>

加藤さん、婚約したんだって！//I heard that Kato-san got engaged!

そうらしいねえ。//I heard that, too.

結婚はいつなのかな。//I wonder when the wedding will be.

秋らしいよ。//I heard it’s in the fall.

<br>

#### 婚約したんだって！

/// 婚約する {こんやくする} means “to get engaged.”

/// 婚約したんだって is a shortened version of 婚約したのだと聞きました “I heard from someone that someone else got engaged.”

<br>

#### そうらしい

/// This phrase is often used to agree with the addressee’s statement.

/// The phrase literally means “it seems that way.”

<br>

### (2) As I said earlier

<br>

やっと、運転免許が取れたよ。今度の土曜日、ドライブに行かない？//I finally got my drivers’ license. Do you want to go for a ride this Saturday?

よかったわね。でも、今度の土曜日はちょっと・・・//That’s great! But this Saturday isn’t a good time for me.

都合が悪いの？残念だなあ。今、紅葉がきれいだということだから・・・//It’s not? Too bad. I heard the autumn foliage is really pretty now.

さっきも言ったように、土曜日はちょっと、都合が悪いの。//As I said, Saturday won’t work for me.

<br>

#### 運転免許（うんてんめんきょ）

/// 免許（めんきょ） refers to any kind of “certificate.” Here, the combination means “drivers’ license.”

<br>

#### ドライブに行く

/// This indicates a ride taken in an automobile for pleasure.

<br>

#### 都合が悪い

/// 都合（つごう） is a noun that means “the personal circumstances that may or may not be convenient for a certain event.”

/// 都合がいい is used when there is no conflict, and 都合が悪い {つごう が わるい} is used when there is conflict.

<br>

#### 紅葉（こうよう）

/// The kanji 紅 indicates the color red; the second kanji 葉 means “leaves.”

/// Together, it means “red leaves,” referring to the autumn foliage.

<br>

#### (3) She seems so Japanese

<br>

ブラウンさん、本当に日本語がペラペラですね。//Brown-san is so fluent in Japanese!

本当に。まるで、日本人ですね、彼女は。//She really is. She’s just like a Japanese person.

でも、日本食にはなかなか苦労しているようですよ。//But I heard she has a hard time with Japanese food.

そうなんですか。//Is that so?

<br>

#### 苦労する

/// 苦労 {くろう} means “hardship.” It can be used for many different situations.

/// Here, the word refers to a person having a difficult time with Japanese food.

/// The word may be used to refer to hardship in personal relations as well.

/// In all cases, the particle に is used for the things that a person is having a hard time with.

<br>

#### まるで日本人ですね

/// In the grammar section of this chapter, まるで is introduced with みたい and よう, but in the above sentence, neither is used.

/// In conversation, this deletion is frequent. Here, the meaning of よう or みたい is implied.stage ３，３。

# Stage 3-3 Embedded Information

<br>

## 1: Embedded Clauses

/// Embedded clauses are the clauses that are buried in certain structures.

/// Quite a few structures with embedded clauses have already been introduced so far.

<br>

/// In this section, the focus will be on how embedded clauses connect to main predicates and modify nouns.

<br>

### (1) Review

#### The use of と when reporting

/// Some quotes or thoughts may be conveyed by such verbs as 言う {いう}, 思う {おもう}, and 聞く {きく}.

/// The content of quotes (direct or indirect) or thoughts is connected to the final verb by the particle と.

<br>

日本語は難しい言葉だと言われています。//It has been said that Japanese is a difficult language.

日本語はそんなに難しい言葉だとは思いません。//I don’t think Japanese is such a difficult language.

あの人は一年生だと聞きました。//I heard that that person is a freshman.

<br>

#### Using か in embedded questions

/// When the content of the speaker’s report is a question, か overrides と.

/// In the sentence below, the speaker summarizes the content.

<br>

あの人に明日は何をするつもりか聞きました。//I asked that person what he was planning to do tomorrow.

<br>

/// When と is added to the sentence above, the meaning changes, making the sentence sound more like a verbatim quote than the speaker’s summary of the content.

<br>

あの人に明日は何をするつもりかと聞きました。//I asked that person, ‘What are you planning to do tomorrow?’

<br>

#### Adjectival clauses

/// Adjectival clauses are embedded clauses that modify the nouns that follow them.

/// The way such a clause is connected to the noun depends on the predicate type in the embedded clause.

/// The following sentences illustrate, in order, the nominal (both noun and adjectival noun), adjectival, and verbal predicate types that are used in embedded clauses.

/// All adjectival clauses in the following examples modify the noun ルームメート.

<br>

私は専攻が日本語のルームメートと一緒に住んでいます。//I live with a roommate whose major is Japanese.

僕は魚が嫌いなルームメートと一緒に住んでいます。//I live with a roommate who doesn’t like fish.

姉は髪が長いルームメートと一緒に住んでいます。//My sister lives with a roommate who has long hair.

兄は皆に頭がいいと言われているルームメートと一緒に住んでいます。//My brother lives with a roommate who everyone says is smart.

<br>

### (2) の・こと・ということ

/// In the following examples, the functional noun こと and the pronoun の are modified by adjectival clauses.

/// As explained in Stage 3–1, the difference between the use of の and こと is that の would imply that the speaker heard Nakada-san playing the piano directly,

/// while こと would imply that the speaker heard from someone else that Nakada-san has been or is playing the piano.

<br>

私は中田さんがピアノをひいているのを聞きました。//I heard Nakada-san playing the piano.

私は中田さんがピアノをひいていることを聞きました。//I heard that Nakada-san is playing the piano.

<br>

/// In embedded clauses connected by こと and those connected by ということ,

/// the difference is that こと is used to convey a fact,

/// while ということ is used to paraphrase the speaker’s interpretation of information.

<br>

私は中田さんがピアノをひいているということを聞きました。//I heard something to the effect that Nakada-san is playing the piano.

<br>

/// In Stage 2–2, the use of こと and ということ was introduced to define a word or a concept.

/// When defining a word by the use of a noun or a noun phrase, ことmay be used in the predicate.

/// See the following example.

<br>

和食は日本の食べ物のことです。//'washoku' refers to food from Japan.

<br>

/// When defining a word by the use of a clause, ということ may be used in the predicate.

/// See the following:

<br>

読書は本を読むということです。//'dokusho' means reading books.

<br>

#### ということ with the verb 知る

/// In the following sentences with the verb 知る {しる}, the thing that the speaker knows is the direct object, which is marked by を.

<br>

私はあの人の名前を知っています。//I know his name.

<br>

/// When the direct object is a clause rather than a noun, ということ must be used:

<br>

私はあの人が一年生だということを知っています。//I know that that person is a freshman.

<br>

## 2: わけ and というわけ

### (1) わけ as an independent noun

/// わけ is a noun that means “interpretation,” “explanation,” or “reason.”

/// The following examples show how this word is used as a noun.

/// When used as a noun, わけ may be expressed in kanji as 訳.

<br>

そのわけが分からない。//I don’t understand the reason.

そのわけを教えて下さい。//Tell me why you think so.

<br>

/// Two fixed expressions in which わけ is used are introduced in the following section.

/// When わけ is used in fixed expressions or in the predicate position, it is not written in kanji.

<br>

#### Fixed expressions with わけがない

/// わけ in this construction means something more like “a way to interpret something.”

/// The fixed expression わけがない literally means “it is not possible to interpret the given situation”;

/// the specific circumstances that are impossible are expressed in the embedded clause that modifies the noun わけ.

<br>

子供にこんな難しい漢字が読めるわけがない。//A child couldn’t read such a difficult kanji.

/// Literally, “it is not possible for a child to be able to read such a difficult kanji.”

<br>

/// The entire embedded clause may be referred to by a pronoun in this construction.

/// Suppose someone has said something, and the speaker wants to respond strongly that what was said is not possible.

<br>

そんなわけがありません。//That is inconceivable.

/// Literally, “Such a thing is not possible.”

<br>

/// が, of course, may be topicalized for a stronger negation.

<br>

そんなわけはありません。//That is absolutely inconceivable.

/// Literally, “Such a thing is not at all possible.”

<br>

#### Fixed expressions with わけにいかない

/// The fixed expression わけにいかない means something like “(the speaker) cannot possibly do (a certain thing)”

/// or “circumstances do not allow the speaker to do such-and-such.”

<br>

今日、そこに行くわけにいきません。//There’s no way that I can go there today.

<br>

/// Because the predicate is in the negative form, は often accompanies に for contrast.

<br>

今日、そこに行くわけにはいきません。//There’s no way that I can go there today.

<br>

/// The verb before わけに（は）いかない must indicate an action that the speaker has control over.

<br>

/// the verb 分かる is a non-action verb.

/// In such a case, はず should be used.

/// Recall that はず is used when the speaker expects a certain event, situation, or result.

/// In the example below, however, はずだ is in the negative.

<br>

私にそれが分かるはずはありません。//I cannot possibly comprehend that.

<br>

### (2) Complex predicates with わけだ

/// Since the noun わけ means “reason,” the complex predicate with わけだ can provide a reason or interpretation.

<br>

あの人は中国人だから、漢字がよく読めるわけです。//The reason that person can read kanji so well is because he is Chinese.

<br>

/// This structure is similar to the complex predicate with の（ん）だ, which also provides a reason or interpretation.

/// Reasoning or interpretation in the complex predicate with のだ, however, indicates a personal explanation,

/// while the reasoning in the complex predicate with わけ refers to an objective interpretation of circumstances.

<br>

昨日、どうして授業に来ませんでしたか。//Why didn’t you come to class yesterday?

<br>

/// In responding to the above question, using のだ sounds better than using わけ,

/// because the speaker is giving a direct personal account of the reason.

<br>

頭が痛かったんです。//Because I had a headache.

<br>

#### という in complex predicates with わけだ

/// Recall that という, with a clause, is used to define a word.

/// In the same way, という is often used to connect the content of the message, which is often an embedded clause, to the predicate with わけだ.

<br>

車が途中で故障して、遅れてしまったというわけです。//The reason I was late is because the car broke down on the way.

<br>

/// In addition, というわけ is often used in questions that ask the addressee to confirm the speaker’s interpretation of the circumstances.

<br>

時間がなかったから電話ができなかったというわけですか。//Are you saying that you couldn’t call me because you didn’t have enough time?

彼が日本にいたから日本語が上手だというわけですか。//Do you mean to say that his Japanese is good because he has been to Japan?

<br>

/// In conversation, it is normal to abbreviate the response by using pronouns.

/// In these cases, the particle と is not used before いう.

<br>

ええ、そういうわけです。//Yes, that’s what I am saying.

/// or “Yes, that’s what I mean.”

<br>

いいえ、そういうわけでは（じゃ）ありません。//No, that’s not what I am saying.

/// or “No, that’s not what I meant.”

<br>



## 3: Embedded Questions

/// Most of the following structures have been already introduced, but there are some important additions below.

/// The following section summarizes all embedded question types.

<br>

### (1) Embedded information-seeking questions

/// The following sentences illustrate how direct and indirect questions are expressed.

/// In indirect questions, there is a difference between the sentences with the quotative と and those without it.

<br>

#### Direct quotation

<br>

友達が私に「この大学の日本語の先生はだれですか。」と聞きました。//My friend asked me, ‘Who is the professor of Japanese at this college?’

友達が「今晩、何をしますか。」と聞きました。//My friend asked me, ‘What will you do tonight?’

<br>

#### Indirect quotation

/// In embedded questions, か must always be used.

/// When と is used after か, the sentence focuses on how the question was asked.

/// When と is not used after か, the sentence conveys the general content of the question.

/// The sentences with both か and と are somewhere between direct and indirect quotation sentences.

<br>

友達が私にこの大学の日本語の先生はだれか（と）聞きました。//My friend asked me who the professor of Japanese at this college is.

友達が今晩、何をするか（と）聞きました。//My friend asked me what I would do tonight.

<br>

### (2) Embedded yes-no questions

/// The following examples show that the copula だ is not used in an indirect quotation, and that どうか may be added after the embedded question.

/// When どうか is used, the quotative と is not used.

<br>

#### Direct quotation

<br>

友達は私に「この大学の日本語の先生は日本人ですか。」と聞きました。//My friend asked me, ‘Is the professor of Japanese at this college a Japanese person?’

<br>

#### Indirect quotation

<br>

友達は私にこの大学の日本語の先生は日本人か（と）聞きました。//My friend asked me, ‘Is the professor of Japanese at this college a Japanese person?’

友達は私にこの大学の日本語の先生は日本人かどうか聞きました。//My friend asked me whether the professor of Japanese at this college is Japanese or not.

<br>

### (3) Embedded alternative questions

/// For embedded alternative questions, either use どうか after the first question, or list two questions side by side if both use the same predicates with different aspects.

/// When listing two questions, the use of と conveys information as to how the question was worded rather than the content of the question.

<br>

#### Direct quotation

<br>

私は友達に「明日、映画に行きますか、行きませんか。」と聞きました。//I asked my friend, ‘Do you want to go to a movie tomorrow or not?’

<br>

#### Indirect quotation

<br>

私は友達に明日、映画に行くかどうか聞きました。//I asked my friend whether or not she would go to a movie tomorrow.

私は友達に明日、映画に行くか行かないか（と）聞きました。//I asked my friend whether or not she would go to a movie tomorrow.

<br>

/// The following sentences illustrate that the alternative question does not always contain the same predicate as the first question.

/// In such cases, どうか may not be used.

<br>

#### Direct quotation

<br>

友達に「あなたのお母さんは日本人ですか、アメリカ人ですか。」と聞きました。//I asked my friend, ‘Is your mother Japanese or American?’

<br>

#### Indirect quotation

<br>

私は友達に彼のお母さんは日本人かアメリカ人か（と）聞きました。//I asked my friend if his mother was Japanese or American.

## 4: Adjectival Clauses

/// It has already been pointed out that embedded clauses are frequently adjectival clauses.

/// The following section introduces new information regarding embedded clauses that are adjectival clauses.

<br>

### (1) Fixed expressions

#### [Imperfective verb] ことがある

/// As explained in Stage 2–2, a perfective verb with ことがある expresses the topic’s past experience.

<br>

あの山に登ったことがあります。//I have climbed that mountain.

/// Literally, “I have had the experience of climbing that mountain in the past.”

<br>

/// When an imperfective predicate is used before ことがある, it expresses an entirely different concept.

/// When the verb before ことがある is in the imperfective, it refers to events that take place occasionally.

<br>

母に日本語で話すことがあります。//There are occasions when I speak to my mother in Japanese.

<br>

/// The sentence above conveys the following nuance:

/// the speaker normally speaks to her or his mother in English (or another non-Japanese language, depending on the context),

/// but there are some occasions on which the speaker talks to her or his mother in Japanese.

<br>

/// The following sentence illustrates a negative imperfective verb being used before ことがある.

/// This sentence implies that the speaker normally eats breakfast, but there are occasions when he or she skips it.

<br>

朝ご飯を食べないことがあります。//There are times that I don’t eat breakfast.

<br>

### (2) Perfective forms in adjectival clauses

/// One of the uses of the ~ている construction is to express a state of events.

<br>

私の父はぼうしをかぶっています。//My father has a hat on.

<br>

/// An interesting characteristic of this structure is that the perfective predicate may be used for description.

/// This is only true with adjectival clauses, however.

<br>

あのぼうしをかぶっている人は私の父です。//The person who has a hat on is my father.

あのぼうしをかぶった人は私の父です。//The person who has a hat on is my father.

<br>

/// This may not be applied to ~ている constructions that are not descriptive in nature.

<br>

ルームメートは起きています。//My roommate is awake.

あの起きている学生が私のルームメートです。//The student who is up is my roommate.

<br>

### (3) Double questions

/// The structure discussed here is quite unique.

/// The following question sentences contain both yes-no and information-seeking questions.

/// Let us call these kinds of question sentences “double questions.”

/// In these sentences, the embedded clause and the main clause are both interrogative clauses.

<br>

このバスはどこに行くバスですか。//Where is it that this bus goes?

/// Literally, “This bus is the bus that goes where?”

<br>

あの先生は何を教えている先生ですか。//What is it that that teacher teaches?

/// Literally, “That teacher is the teacher who teaches what?”

<br>

/// Double questions are used when at least some of the possible options are known to the speaker, and she or he asks for the answer to a specific option.

/// For instance, the person asking the first question above knows that there are a certain number of possible destinations for the buses.

/// The reading of the second sentence is the same: the options are at least somewhat known to the speaker and the addressee.

<br>

/// When the options are not known, the following simple question sentences are used instead of the double questions above, making them open-ended questions.

<br>

このバスはどこに行きますか。//Where does this bus go?

あの先生は何を教えていますか。//What does that teacher teach?

<br>

#### A possible situation for a double question

/// Suppose the speaker is waiting for a bus because she wants to go to destination A.

/// She knows that there are three buses that go to different destinations from the bus stop where she is waiting.

/// She sees a bus coming to the stop.

/// When the bus arrives, she approaches the bus driver and asks where that particular bus is going, in order to see whether or not it is the right bus for her.

/// In this case, she can use the double question construction.

<br>

このバスはどこに行くバスですか。//Which way is it that this bus is going?

<br>

/// Because of the nature of double questions, if the noun the embedded question clause modifies is a specific noun, a double question is not acceptable.

/// In this case, it is better to simply ask the open-ended question.

<br>

あなたのお父さんは何を教えていますか。//What does your father teach?

<br>

## 5: Volitional Forms in Embedded Clauses

/// The meaning of phrases in which volitional forms are used differs depending on the verb that accompanies the volitional form.

/// The volitional form with the verb する was introduced in Stage 3–2.

/// Another structure will be added in this chapter, after a review of direct and indirect quotations with a volitional form in the predicate.

<br>

### (1) The volitional form in quotes

/// The following sentences contain direct and indirect quotes with predicates in which volitional forms are used.

<br>

#### Direct quotation

<br>

私はルームメートに「一緒に映画に行きましょう。」と誘いました。//I invited my roommate, saying, ‘Let’s go to the movie together.’

<br>

#### Indirect quotation

<br>

私はルームメートに一緒に映画に行こうと誘いました。//I invited my roommate to go to the movie with me.

<br>

### (2) The volitional form with 思う

/// The volitional form is used with 思う to express the speaker’s intention.

/// In this structure, the continuous 思っている is often used to express a thought regarding an action in the near future.

<br>

今晩、映画に行こうと思っています。//I’m thinking about going to a movie tonight.

<br>

/// The use of the volitional form and 思う is similar to the structure with つもり that expresses the speaker’s plan.

/// The difference between the two structures is that the sentence with つもり implies that the plan is firm,

/// while the volitional form with 思う gives the impression that it is still a tentative plan.

<br>

今晩、映画に行くつもりです。//I’m planning to go to a movie tonight.

<br>

/// When the predicate form before 思う is not in the volitional form,

/// the sentence indicates that the speaker thinks that someone else will go to the movie;

/// there is no possibility that it is the speaker who might go to the movie.

<br>

田村さんは今晩、映画に行くと思います。//I think that Tamura-san will go to a movie tonight.

<br>

/// The above sentence indicates that the speaker believes that 田村さん {たむらさん} will go to the movie.

/// Even when the person who will go to the movie is not named, the sentence still does not mean that it is the speaker who will go to the movie.

<br>

今晩、映画に行くと思います。//I think that (someone) will go to a movie tonight.

<br>

### (3) The volitional form with する

/// In Stage 3–2, it was explained that combining the volitional form and the verb する expresses the notion that the speaker was about to take some action, but could not (which is expressed in the main-clause).

<br>

買い物に行こうとしましたが、友達が来て、行けませんでした。//I was about to go shopping, but I couldn’t go because my friend dropped by.

<br>

/// The meaning of the above construction is similar to that of one of the structures with the complex predicate with ところだ, which will be introduced shortly.

<br>

勉強しようとしましたが、できませんでした。//I was about to study, but I couldn’t.

勉強するところでしたが、できませんでした。//I was about to study, but I couldn’t.

<br>

/// The difference between the two sentences above will be discussed after the explanation of complex predicates with ところだ below.

<br>

## 6: Complex Predicates with ところだ

/// The noun 所 {ところ} has been introduced as a word meaning “place.”

/// ところ used in the complex predicate indicates a place as well, but it refers to a place in time.

/// When ところ is used in complex predicates, it is not written in kanji.

<br>

### (1) With imperfective verbs

/// When the imperfective predicate is embedded before ところ, the sentence indicates that the action expressed has not yet begun.

/// The literal meaning of the sentence is therefore “someone is at a place in time when he or she is about to do something.”

<br>

妹は宿題をするところです。//My sister is about to do her homework.

<br>

/// The perfective copula in the following sentence indicates that the topic was about to do something in the past.

/// Therefore, the setting is in the past, but the action did not take place.

<br>

妹は宿題をするところでした。//My sister was about to do her homework.

<br>

### (2) With perfective verbs

/// When the embedded predicate is perfective, the literal meaning of the sentence is “someone is at the point where he/she just finished doing something.”

<br>

妹は宿題をしたところです。//My sister has just done her homework.

<br>

/// When the copula is perfective, it indicates that the action was completed at a certain time in the past that the speaker has referred to in the discourse.

<br>

妹は宿題をしたところでした。//My sister had just done her homework.

<br>

#### The difference between the two structures

/// The following two structures were presented above in terms of the difference between them because they express a very similar meaning.

<br>

勉強しようとしましたが、できませんでした。//I was about to study, but I couldn’t.

勉強するところでしたが、できませんでした。//I was about to study, but I couldn’t.

<br>

/// The first sentence may be used in a situation in which the speaker has actually started studying but was interrupted many times and could not complete what he or she had intended to complete.

/// The second sentence cannot be used in that situation, as the structure indicates that the speaker has not even started the action.

<br>

### (3) With ~ている

/// It is possible to use the continuous aspect with this complex predicate.

/// The meaning of this construction is “the person is at the point where she or he is in the middle of doing something.”

<br>

妹は宿題をしているところです。//My sister is doing her homework right now.

<br>

/// The sentence above closely resembles the following one in meaning:

<br>

妹は宿題をしています。//My sister is doing her homework (right now).

<br>

#### Difference between ~ている and ~ているところ

/// As indicated above, the continuous aspect may be expressed by ~ている or ~ているところ.

/// The difference between these two structures is that sentences with ~ているところ emphasize the current action rather than the continuous aspect.

<br>

/// ~ている, as has been introduced earlier, may express an ongoing action or an event that has been taking place since some time in the past.

/// This latter meaning may not be expressed by the complex predicate with ところだ.

<br>

妹は九時から宿題をしています。//My sister has been doing her homework since 9:00.

<br>

/// ~ている can also be used to expresses a continuous state.

/// ~ているところmay not be used in these cases, either.

<br>

姉はもう起きています。//My sister is awake already.

### (1) Do you know what I’m saying?

<br>

私の言ってることが分かりますか。//Do you know what I’m saying?

だめだというわけですか。//Are you saying, “No”?

<br>

/// こと refers to the content of what someone has said.

<br>

### (2) It’s good, but…

<br>

どうですか、あの人の日本語は？//How’s that person’s Japanese?

上手なことは上手ですが・・・//It’s good, but . . .

<br>

#### 上手なことは上手ですが・・・ {じょうず なことは じょうず ですが・・・}

/// This expression affirms the addressee’s expectation, but not without a condition.

/// This second sentence means something like, “The person’s Japanese is good, as you might imagine, but . . .” (the speaker obviously wants to add a few qualifying comments).

<br>

### (3) I wouldn’t worry about her

<br>

大丈夫でしょうか。//Do you think she’s all right?

あの人のことだから、大丈夫ですよ。//I wouldn’t worry about her.

<br>

#### あの人のことだから・・・

/// This sentence means something like, “because of who he or she is.”

/// The entire sentence therefore means something like, “Of course she’s all right, because you know how she is.”

<br>

### (4) I really don’t think that’s true

<br>

彼は私の言うことは聞かないと思いますが・・・//I don’t think he’ll listen to what I have to say.

それはどういうことですか。そんなことは絶対にないと思います。//What do you mean? I really don’t think that’s true.

もう一度、彼に言うところですが・・・//I’ll tell him again, but . . .

<br>

#### 私の言うことは聞かない

/// In this case, 聞く means that the person would do what the speaker asked him to do.

<br>

#### それはどういうことですか

/// This expression asks for clarification.

<br>

#### そんなことは絶対にない

/// This expresses a strong negation: “I really don’t think that would be the case.”

/// 絶対に {ぜったい に} is an adverb meaning “absolutely; definitely.”

/// It is acceptable to say this phrase without an adverb, as in そんなことはない, “I don’t think that’s how it is.”stage ３，４。

# Stage 3-4 Sentences of Causation

<br>

## 1: Causative Sentences

/// As mentioned in Stage 1–9, causative sentences, which are characterized by the use of causative verbs, express a person’s causing another person to do something.

/// The situation varies: it could be that the topic forces someone to do something, allows someone to do something, lets someone do something, or has someone do something, depending on the context.

/// In all these situations in Japanese, the topic of the causative sentence is a person with greater authority than the person mentioned in the object position.

/// When the topic has less authority than the person in the object position, a causative sentence may not be used.

/// In this case, other constructions must be used, some of which will be introduced in this chapter.

<br>

### (1) Causative verb formation

/// Group 1: Change る to させる

/// Group 2: Change the final {u} to {a} and add せる

/// Group 3: [する → させる], [くる → こさせる]

<br>

/// All derived causative verbs are Group 1 verbs.

/// The following examples show how they conjugate: たべさせる → たべさせて, かわせる → かわせて.

<br>

### (2) Verbs with no causative forms

/// There are a few groups of verbs that lack causative forms.

<br>

/// - Verbs that express non-actions or non-events lack the corresponding causative verbs.

/// For instance, some semi-transitive verbs, such as ある “to have; to exist” and 要る {いる} “to need,” do not have causative forms.

<br>

/// - The intransitive counterpart in a transitive-intransitive verb pair lacks a causative form:

/// e.g. 開く {あく}  “(something) opens” and 閉まる {しまる} “(something) closes.”

<br>

/// - Honorific verbs also lack causative forms:

/// e.g. いらっしゃる “to be”; “to go”; “to come,” くださる “to give (me),” おっしゃる “to say.”

<br>

### (3) Causative sentences

/// Causative sentences have several different meanings, as shown in the English translation of the example below.

/// In some cases, only the context can determine which meaning the sentence conveys.

/// But in all cases, the person in the topic position has more power than the person in the object place.

/// It is therefore inappropriate to use a causative sentence to express the idea of a person with less power making a person with more power do something.

<br>

先生は学生に日本語を話させます。//The teacher makes/allows/lets the student speak Japanese.

<br>

/// When expressing more than one causative action with the たり-form, the causative element may be either in the final verb する, or in a verb in the non-final position, but not in both.

/// For instance, to describe the things a teacher makes his students do in class, the following sentence uses causative elements in the non-final position.

<br>

先生は学生に漢字を書かせたり、日本語を話させたりします。//The teacher makes his students do things like write kanji and speak Japanese.

<br>

/// In the following sentence, the causative form is in the final verb する.

<br>

先生は学生に漢字を書いたり、日本語を話したりさせます。//The teacher makes his students do things like write kanji and speak Japanese.

<br>

### (4) The use of に and を with directional verbs

/// Some linguists say that different causative meanings can be identified by the use of different particles.

/// For instance, compare the following two sentences:

<br>

中村さんは子供にイギリスに行かせます。//Nakamura-san will allow his child to go to England.

<br>

中村さんは子供をイギリスに行かせます。//Nakamura-san will make his child go to England.

/// Literally, “Nakamura-san will force his child to go to England.

<br>

/// It is commonly said and believed that the use of に conveys the meaning of allowing,

/// whereas the use of を in the second sentence above would imply that the child is going despite his or her wishes to the contrary.

/// It is true that the difference between these sentences can be interpreted that way, but the difference is not as distinct as some linguists believe it to be.

/// Both of these sentences actually more or less convey the meaning of “making someone go somewhere.”

<br>

/// First of all, if this difference exists, it is a very slight one, and is true only when the verb expresses direction;

/// it does not apply to most other verbs.

/// Furthermore, regardless of the particle choice, に or を, the original meaning of the causative sentence still holds for both sentences;

/// that is, a person with power is causing a person with less power to do something.

/// Most importantly, to convey the meaning of allowing a person to do something, a more appropriate Japanese sentence would contain a giving verb in the predicate, as shown below.

<br>

中村さんは子供にイギリスに行かせてやりました。//Nakamura-san allowed his child to go to England.

<br>

### (5) The use of に and を with other verbs

/// In this section, the use of に and を with verbs other than the directional verbs will be examined.

/// See the following example with the verb 笑う {わらう}, which means “to laugh”:

<br>

あの人はいつも面白い話をして、人を笑わせます。//That person always tells funny stories, and makes people laugh.

<br>

/// In this case, the use of を indicates that the topic makes people laugh.

/// It would be unnatural to interpret the sentence as saying that the topic allows or forces another person to laugh, since the verb expresses an involuntary action.

/// For involuntary actions, を should be used for the person who is being made to do the action.

/// A similar example can be found in the following sentence, where the act of crying is an involuntary action.

<br>

あの人はいつも子供を泣かせます。//That person always makes children cry.

<br>

/// In some artificial cases, it is possible for someone to have someone else do things such as laugh or cry.

/// For instance, if a movie director wanted to have an actor laugh in a particular scene, the use of に rather than を would indicate that.

<br>

その時に、チャンさんに笑わせます。//At that time, I will make Chang-san laugh.

<br>

#### General rule for に or を for the person in the object position

/// The basic meaning conveyed by a causative sentence, regardless of the predicate used, is that the person in the topic position makes the person in the object position do something.

/// The implication is that the person in the object position carries out an action as a result.

/// The person in the object position of a causative sentence may be marked either by に or を, but these particles are not interchangeable.

<br>

/// When the verb is a transitive verb, the person who is made to act must be marked by に.

/// を may not be used here, because the direct object of the verb is marked by を.

<br>

あのうちでは、親は子供に自分のご飯を料理させます。//At that house, the parents have the children prepare their own meals.

<br>

/// For intransitive verbs, the person in the object position may be marked by に or を.

/// When を is used, it implies that the action taken by this person is an involuntary action.

/// In the following sentence, being upset is not a controllable action.

<br>

あの人はいつも私を怒らせます。//That person always makes me upset.

<br>

/// The reason some linguists believe that the use of を gives a coercive meaning may be due to this involuntary meaning conveyed by を.

/// That is, the sentence conveys the meaning of “an act not carried out deliberately” by the person mentioned in the object position.

<br>

/// When に is used, it indicates that a person deliberately carries out the action indicated by the verb:

<br>

今日は、スミスさんに泳がせるつもりだ。//I am planning to have Smith-san swim today.

<br>

### (6) て-causatives with ください

/// The て-form of a causative verb with ください indicates that the speaker is volunteering to do something.

<br>

この飲み物は私に買わせてください。//Please let me buy this drink.

<br>

/// The speaker can also use this structure to request that someone else (a third person) do something.

/// In this case, the speaker must be in an authoritative position over both the addressee and the person who is being made to do something.

<br>

掃除は妹にさせてください。でも、洗濯は兄にさせてください。//Have my younger sister do the cleaning. But have my brother do laundry.

<br>

## 2: Other Causative Forms

### (1) Short causative forms

/// There is another set of causative forms called short causative forms.

/// They are used frequently in conversation.

/// The short causative forms can be obtained by changing the causative suffix せる to す.

<br>

/// - Meaning

/// eat wait buy come do

/// - Base form

/// たべる まつ かう くる する

/// - Long causative form

/// たべさせる またせる かわせる こさせる させる

/// - Short causative form

/// たべさす またす かわす こさす さす

<br>

/// All short causative verbs are Group 2 verbs:

/// たべさす → たべさします → たべさして; かえらす → かえらします → かえらして; こさす → こさします → こさして.

<br>

/// Short causative forms are used more often in casual settings than long causative forms.

/// However, there are individual as well as regional differences in the use of long and short causative forms.

/// Compare the long and short causative verbs in the following sentences:

<br>



あの人はいつも私を待たせます。//That person always makes me wait.

/// [long causative]

<br>

あの人はいつも私を待たします。//That person always makes me wait.

/// [short causative]

<br>

### (2) Causative-like verbs

/// Some verbs have inherent causative-like meanings.

/// For instance, 起こす {おこす} means “to wake someone up”; and 着せる {きせる} “to put an outfit on someone else.”

/// These verbs are used as shown below:

<br>

母は妹を毎朝、７時に起こします。//My mother wakes my sister up at 7:00 every morning.

寒い日には、私は赤ちゃんにセーターを着せます。//On cold days, I put a sweater on the baby.

<br>

/// These verbs resemble causative verbs in that the topic causes someone to do or undergo something (e.g. my sister wakes up; the baby wears an outfit).

/// There is, however, a basic difference between the sentences above and sentences with causative verbs:

/// sentences with causative verbs indicate that the topic causes someone to actively do something.

/// Neither of the sentences above indicates such a voluntary action by the object.

<br>

/// In fact, these verbs do have causative forms, as shown below.

/// In the example sentences, the person marked by に actively carries out an action at the topic’s behest.

<br>

母は兄に妹を毎朝、７時に起こさせます。//My mother makes my brother wake up my sister at 7:00 every morning.

私は上の子供に赤ちゃんにセーターを着せさせます。//I have my older child put a sweater on the baby.

<br>

## 3: Other Constructions of Causation

/// The use of causative verbs is not the only way to indicate that someone causes someone else to do something.

<br>

### (1) ~て欲（ほ）しい

/// Recall that the stem with ~たい is a structure expressing the speaker’s desire to do something.

<br>

私はもっと勉強したいです。//I want to study more.

<br>

/// This structure may not be used when the speaker wants other people do something.

/// For this purpose, the て-form of the verb and the adjective 欲しい {ほしい} is used.

<br>

#### Positive

/// The following sentences demonstrate the use of the positive predicate:

<br>

私はあなたにもっと勉強して欲しいです。//I want you to study more.

あの会議では私は森さんに話して欲しいと思っています。//I want Mori-san to speak at that meeting.

<br>

/// Since 欲しい, an emotive adjective, is a part of this structure, this construction may be used only when the speaker is expressing his or her own wish or when the speaker is asking the addressee a question directly.

/// Like other emotive words, this structure may not be used to describe a third person’s wish unless another element is added in the predicate.

/// Many such elements may be added; they all convey different nuances. The following is one such example:

<br>

田中先生は学生にもっと勉強して欲しいようです。//It seems that Tanaka-sensei wants his students to study more.

<br>

#### Negative

/// There are two ways to negate the ~て欲しい construction.

<br>

あの会議では私は森さんに話して欲しくないと思っています。//I don’t want Mori-san to speak at that meeting.

あの会議では私は森さんに話さないで欲しいと思っています。//I don’t want Mori-san to say anything at that meeting.

<br>

/// The difference in meaning between the two is subtle:

/// the first sentence is based on the possibility that Mori-san might say something,

/// but the second sentence does not necessarily assume it.

<br>

#### Causative-て + 欲しい

/// Compare the following three sentences:

<br>

私に行かせてください。//Please let me go.

私に行かせて欲しいです。//I want you to let me go.

中村さんに行かせて欲しいです。//I want you to let Nakamura-san go.

<br>

/// The first sentence is a direct request, while the latter two express requests by using statement sentences.

<br>

### (2) Causatives and ~てもらう（~ていただく）

/// As has been pointed out more than once, only a person with greater authority can be the topic of a causative sentence.

/// For instance, in a case where a mother makes her child do something, the use of a causative sentence is appropriate.

<br>

うちの子に先生に手紙を書かせました。//I made my child write a letter to her teacher.

<br>

/// The following explanation and example sentences deal with a different power dynamic than the one in the situation above.

/// Suppose the speaker needs to ask someone with an equal level of authority to do something on her or his behalf.

/// In this case, it would not be appropriate to use a causative.

/// Instead, the use of ~てもらう (or ~ていただく, depending on whom the speaker asks) is more appropriate.

/// The sentence implies that the topic asked the person in the object position to do something and received the favor as a result of asking.

<br>

私はルームメートに手紙を書いてもらいました。//I had my roommate write a letter for me.

<br>

/// The following sentence is an example of a speaker making a request to someone who is in a position of greater authority than the speaker.

<br>

先生にこれを説明していただきました。//I asked the teacher to explain this to me.

<br>

/// When the speaker wants to volunteer something but needs to ask someone else,

/// then a combination of a causative verb and the verb もらう or いただく is necessary.

<br>

翻訳は私にさせてもらいました。//I requested that I be allowed to do the translation.

<br>

/// The difference between ~てもらう（いただく） and ~てくれる（くださる） may be reviewed in Stage 2–4.

<br>

## 4: Causative-Passive Verbs and Sentences

### (1) Causative-passive verb forms

/// Causative verbs may be changed into passive forms.

/// Since all causative verbs are Group 1 verbs, there is only one rule.

/// [る of causative verbs → られる]

<br>

/// The reverse does not work; that is, passive verbs cannot be changed into causative verbs.

<br>

/// - Base form

/// たべる いく かう する くる

/// - Causative form

/// たべさせる いかせる かわせる させる こさせる

/// - Causative-passive form

/// たべさせられる いかせられる かわせられる させられる こさせられる

<br>

子供の時、私は両親にミルクをたくさん飲ませられました。//When I was a child, I was made to drink a lot of milk by my parents.

日本語の授業では、いつも宿題をたくさんさせられます。//We are always made to do a lot of homework for our Japanese class.

<br>

### (2) Short causative-passive verb forms

/// Just as causatives have the short causative form, there is also a corresponding passive form called the short causative-passive form.

<br>

/// As mentioned earlier, all short causatives are Group 2 verbs that end with す.

/// The rule for changing this into the passive is therefore as follows:

/// [Change the final vowel u to a and add れる]

<br>

/// Examples of short causative-passives

/// - Base form

/// いく まつ かう

/// - Long causative

/// いかせる またせる かわせる

/// - Short causative

/// いかす またす かわす

/// - Short causative-passive

/// いかされる またされる かわされる

<br>

彼と待ち合わせをする時は、いつも待たされます。//I am always made to wait for him when I meet with him.

あの店に行くと、いつも要らない物をたくさん買わされます。//Whenever I go to that store, I am always made to buy many unnecessary things.

<br>

#### Awkward short causative-passive forms

/// The short causative-passives are used most often with the original (i.e. not derived) Group 2 verbs.

/// The original Group 1 and 3 verbs result in the syllable repetition of ささ, which makes the forms awkward.

/// The only verbs among the original Group 2 verbs that produce such an awkward form are those that end with ~す, like 話す.

/// The following illustrates some awkward short causative-passive forms.

/// They are awkward, but some may be used colloquially.

<br>

/// - Base form

/// たべる する くる はなす

/// - Long causative

/// たべさせる させる こさせる はなさせる

/// - Short causative

/// たべさす さす こさす はなさす

/// - Short causative-passive

/// たべさされる さされる こさされる はなさされる

# Stage 3-5 Expressions of Simultaneous Events

<br>

## 1: Review of ながら and あいだ（に）

/// There are many structures that express two simultaneous events in Japanese.

/// Many of these constructions are equated with English sentences in which “while” functions as a connector.

/// Sentences expressing simultaneous events with ながら-phrases and あいだ（に）-clauses were introduced in Stage 2–5.

/// This chapter begins with a summary of the differences between these two structures and goes on to introduce new constructions that express similar concepts.

<br>

### (1) Adverbial phrases with ながら

/// Adverbial phrases with ながら are used to express a secondary action that accompanies a main action when both are performed by the same person.

<br>

私はいつも新聞を読みながら、勉強します。//I always read newspapers while studying.

<br>

/// The ながら-adverbial phrase may not be used to describe simultaneous actions performed by different people, however.

/// In addition, if one of the predicates is stative, not active, the ながら-adverbial may not be used.

<br>

### (2) Adverbial clauses with あいだ（に）

/// An adverbial clause with あいだ（に） may be used for simultaneous actions performed by the same person, or by different people.

/// It can also be used for continuous actions, stative events, and even punctual events.

<br>

/// In the following sentences, two different individuals are doing two different things at the same time.

/// When the action expressed in the main clause is shorter in duration than that in the adverbial clause, the particle に should be used immediately after あいだ.

<br>

子供が寝ている間、私は勉強しました。//I studied during the time that my child was sleeping.

子供が寝ている間に、私は勉強しました。//I studied for part of the time that my child was sleeping.

<br>

/// This construction can be used to express simultaneous states as well as simultaneous actions.

<br>

私は日本にいる間、漢字をたくさん勉強しました。//I studied a lot of kanji when I was in Japan.

<br>

## 2: Simultaneous Events with Other Adverbials

### (1) Adverbial clauses with うちに

/// The most salient feature of the structure in which clauses are connected with うちに is that the condition stated in the うち-clause is expected to change relatively soon.

/// うち comes from the noun うち “inside.”

/// The literal interpretation of the condition marked by うち is therefore something like “within the time that the condition holds true.”

/// あいだ-clauses do not have such an assumption regarding changes of condition.

<br>

お茶が熱いうちに、飲んで下さい。//Please drink the tea before it gets cold.

/// Literally, “while it’s still hot”

<br>

あの人がここにいるうちに、聞いておいた方がいいですよ。//You’d better ask him while he is still here.

<br>

/// Because change is a prominent factor in the うち-clause, negative predicates are often used in this clause.

<br>

雨が降らないうちに、家に帰りましょう。//Let’s go home before it starts raining.

/// Literally, “while it’s still not raining”

<br>

寒くならないうちに、部屋に入ってください。//Please go inside before it gets cold.

/// Literally, “while it’s not cold yet”

<br>

### (2) Adverbial phrases with まま（で）

/// Like ながら-adverbials, adverbial phrases with まま are used to express two simultaneous events concerning the same person.

/// This structure cannot be used to discuss simultaneous events concerning different people.

/// The difference between the two structures is that the verb used in the まま-adverbial phrase must be punctual; that is, non-continuous, in nature.

/// In addition, the perfective form of the verb must be used immediately before まま in this phrase, because the phrase implies a state of completed action expressed by the verb.

/// で after まま is optional.

<br>

電車の中で立ったまま（で）、寝てしまいました。//I fell asleep standing on the train.

/// Literally, “I had stood up on the train, and in that state, I fell asleep.”

<br>

服を着たまま（で）、寝てしまいました。//I fell asleep with my clothes on.

/// Literally, “I had put my clothes on, and in that state, I fell asleep.”

<br>

めがねをかけたまま（で）、泳がないで下さい。//Please don’t swim with your glasses on.

/// Literally, “If you have put your glasses on and are still in that state, don’t swim.”

<br>

### (3) ~ながら with stative verbs

/// ながら-phrases have two different functions.

/// The function introduced in Stage 2–5 describes a secondary action accompanying a main action.

/// The second function, which is introduced in this section, is similar to ~ても or のに.

/// In this case, the verb in the phrase with ~ながら must be stative.

/// Using ~ ながら in this way is quite formal.

<br>

あの人は、家にいながら、電話に出ないのは、変ですね。//It’s strange that he’s not answering the phone even though he’s home.

彼はお金がありながら、物を買うことが好きじゃないんですよ。//Hard to believe, but he doesn’t like to buy things, even though he has money.

<br>

/// With adjectives (including adjectival nouns) and adverbs, ながら is used immediately after the word.

/// That is, the form of an adjective does not change in this construction.

<br>

彼女は、小さいながら、とっても元気です。//Although she is small, she is very energetic.

あの人は、ゆっくりながら、日本語をとても上手に話します。//Although she speaks slowly, she speaks Japanese very well.

<br>

### (4) Conjunctions （そのまま・そのうちに・そのあいだに）

/// The conjunctions used for adverbial clauses introduced in this chapter, such as まま and うちに, may actually be used as sentential and clausal conjunctions.

/// In this case, the demonstrative その must precede them.

/// The following pairs of examples illustrate the sentential and clausal uses of these conjunctions.

<br>

とても疲れて、６時頃、ソファに横になった。でも、そのまま、朝まで寝てしまった。//I lay down on the sofa at around 6:00 because I was so tired. But I ended up sleeping until morning.

とても疲れて、６時頃、ソファに横になったら、そのまま、朝まで寝てしまった。//I lay down on the sofa at around 6:00 because I was so tired, and ended up sleeping until morning.

<br>

テレビを見ていた。そしたら、そのうちに、寝てしまった。//I was watching TV. As I sat there watching, I fell asleep.

テレビを見ていたら、そのうちに、寝てしまった。//I was watching TV, and fell asleep as I sat there.

<br>

私は電話で話していた。その間に、ルームメートは晩ご飯を食べてしまった。//I was talking on the phone. While I was still talking, my roommate finished her dinner.

私は電話で話していたら、その間に、ルームメートは晩ご飯を食べてしまった。//During the time I was talking on the phone, my roommate finished her dinner.

<br>

## 3: Similar Adverbial Phrases

/// There are a number of adverbs and adverbial phrases that are quite close in meaning.

/// Knowing the nuances and implications of each of these is very important for successful communication.

/// Some of these adverbs have been already introduced and used, but the following overview presents them all in the same place.

<br>

### (1) せいで and おかげで

/// To attribute the cause of something to another person or thing, せいで or おかげで can be used.

/// The difference between the two is that せいで refers to a negative cause and おかげで to a positive one.

<br>

あなたのせいで、私は試験に失敗しました。//Because of you, I failed the examination.

/// [i.e., it’s the addressee’s fault]

<br>

あなたのおかげで、私は試験に通りました。//Thanks to you, I passed the examination.

<br>

/// The expression おかげさまで,a more polite phrasing ofおかげで, was introduced in the Preparatory Stage, as in the following:

<br>

おかげさまで、元気です。//Thanks to you, I’m well.

<br>

#### せい or おかげ in predicates

/// せい and おかげ may also be used in the nominal predicate.

<br>

あなたが試験に失敗したのは、私のせいです。//It’s my fault that you failed the examination.

私が試験に通ったのは、あなたのおかげです。//Thanks to your help, I passed the test.

<br>

### (2) ほとんど and めったに

/// Some adverbs, such as あまり, そんなに, and 全然（ぜんぜん）, require the predicate to be in the negative form.

/// There are a few more in this category, including ほとんど and めったに, which will be introduced in this section.

<br>

/// ほとんど, which refers to frequency, means “almost never.”

<br>

私は家にほとんど電話しません。//I hardly ever call home.

<br>

/// The adverb めったに indicates a little more frequency than ほとんど, but it is still not often.

<br>

うちの子供はめったに田中さんのお子さんと遊びません。//My child rarely plays with Tanaka-san’s child.

<br>

/// The adverbs 全然（ぜんぜん）, ほとんど, and めったに differ in degree of frequency.

/// The frequency increases from not at all to more frequent, in the following order:

/// 全然 → ほとんど → めったに

<br>

### (3) わざわざ and せっかく

/// In many Japanese–English dictionaries, わざわざ and せっかく are defined similarly as “deliberately; with much trouble.”

/// Adverbs are in general very difficult to translate into another language, because the implications of a given adverb tend to be quite different in each language.

/// As ever, understanding the underlying meaning of each word is more important than learning it via translation alone.

<br>

#### わざわざ

/// This adverb implies that the topic is doing something even though it is not necessary, and that this task may be a lot of trouble to complete.

/// わざわざ may be used in either a dependent or independent clause.

<br>

わざわざ料理したけれども、だれも食べてくれなかった。//I went to the trouble of cooking, but no one ate it.

このパーティーにはわざわざ着物を着なくてもいいですよ。//You needn’t take the trouble to wear a kimono to this party.

<br>

/// Because of its meaning, わざわざ is often used to thank someone for what he or she did.

/// The grateful person wants the addressee to know that it wasn’t necessary to do what was done.

<br>

遠くからわざわざ来てくださって、ありがとうございます。//Thank you for coming here from so far away.

<br>

#### せっかく

/// This adverb indicates that the speaker is taking advantage of his or her current situation to do additional things.

/// The situation described in the dependent clause, in which せっかく is used, provides the opportunity for the action in the independent clause.

/// Because of this structure, せっかく cannot be used in simple sentences.

<br>

せっかくここまで来たのだから、海にも行きましょう。//Since we came all the way here, let’s take advantage of it and go to the beach.

せっかく日本に来たのに、田中さんに会えませんでした。//I came all the way to Japan, but I was unable to see Tanaka-san.

/// Literally, “it was too bad that I couldn’t take advantage of being in Japan to see Tanaka-san”

<br>

/// せっかく may be used to politely decline an offer or invitation by implying that the speaker regrets not being able to take the opportunity.

/// ですが in せっかくですが in this response implies that a more complete structure is abbreviated.

/// This expression has become a fixed expression for declining an offer politely.

<br>

明日、うちにいらっしゃいませんか。//Would you like to come visit me tomorrow?

せっかくですが、明日は行けません。//Thank you for the opportunity, but unfortunately I can’t take advantage of your invitation and visit you tomorrow.

<br>

/// In some cases, わざわざ and せっかく seem to be interchangeable, but there is a difference in nuance originating from the meanings described above.

/// The use of わざわざ modifies the action in the dependent clause, while the use of せっかく gives the reason for the action expressed in the main clause.

<br>

わざわざここまで来たのだから、海にも行きましょう。//Since we took the trouble to come here, let’s go to the beach as well.

せっかくここまで来たのだから、海にも行きましょう。//Since we came all the way here, let’s take advantage of it and go to the beach.

<br>

### (4) やっと and とうとう

/// The adverbs やっと and とうとう, which were introduced in Stages 2–6, may both be translated as “finally” in a dictionary.

/// However, the notions presupposed by these adverbs are quite different.

<br>

/// やっと is used when the speaker’s expectation is reached after a long wait or prolonged effort.

/// In the first sentence below, it sounds as if the speaker has been waiting for rain for quite some time, and this wish has now been fulfilled.

/// In the second sentence, the implication is that the speaker had been making an effort to understand something, and the goal was finally met.

<br>

やっと雨が降ってきました。//The rain that I was hoping for has finally begun.

やっと分かりました。//I finally understood.

<br>

/// とうとう literally means that something has reached its end.

/// This adverb is often, but not always, used when something that the speaker has been afraid might happen actually does happen.

/// This fear does not have to be very strong, however.

<br>

とうとう雨が降ってきました。//It’s starting to rain; I was afraid it would.

とうとうぼくの犬は死んでしまいました。//I was dreading my dog’s death, and it finally happened.

<br>

/// In both cases, the speaker was fearfully anticipating the event in the sentence.

/// In both sentences, the event occurred despite the speaker’s wish that it would not.

<br>

/// Because of the difference in nuance between やっと and とうとう, confusing them could lead to a terrible misunderstanding.

/// For instance, when a long-awaited visitor finally arrives, it is definitely more appropriate to use やっと than とうとう.

<br>

やっと、来たのね。//You’re finally here!

<br>

/// In contrast, when the speaker fears that eventually it will be his or her turn to face something negative, the use of とうとう is more appropriate than やっと.

<br>

とうとう私の番が来てしまいました。//My turn has come, as I knew it would.

<br>

### (5) Adverb あまり with positive predicates

/// あまり was introduced earlier as an adverb that requires a negative predicate.

<br>

この本はあまり面白くありませんでした。//This book was not very interesting.

<br>

/// When this adverb is used with a positive predicate, it stresses that what is expressed in the predicate exceeds expectations.

/// This adverb, however, is used only in a dependent clause;

/// the main clause must express the consequence.

<br>

この本があまり面白かったから、昨日、全部、読んでしまいました。//This book was so interesting that I read the whole thing yesterday.

<br>

/// When あまり is used in this way, the particle に or にも may also accompany it.

<br>

この本があまりに（も）面白かったから、昨日、全部、読んでしまいました。//This book was so interesting that I read the whole thing yesterday.

それはそうですね。//That’s true.

<br>

#### 気がする {きがする}

/// This idiomatic verb expresses the speaker’s hunch.

/// The feeling is not based so much on evidence as it is on the speaker’s instinct.

<br>

#### 物の質 {もののしつ}

/// 質 {しつ} means “quality.” The meaning of this phrase is therefore “the quality of things.”

<br>

#### まだまだ

/// The repetition of まだ emphasizes that things are still quite expensive.

<br>

#### それはそうですね

/// おば：

心配しないで。この頃、私、ピンピンしてるんだから。//Don’t worry. I’m quite healthy these days.

<br>

#### ほんの気持ちだけ

/// ほんの means “just a little bit”;

/// 気持ち {きもち} here refers to “the speaker’s thoughts.”

/// So, ほんの気持ちだけ is often used when a person giving a present wants to say that what he or she is about to give is not a big thing, but that it expresses his or her thoughts.

<br>

#### 卒業のお祝いにと思って

/// This phrase means “I thought this might be a good gift to celebrate your graduation.”

/// お祝い {いわい} means “celebration,” but it is also used to mean “gift.”

/// It means something like “It’s not like that,” or “That’s not true.”

/// ちょうだい is a colloquial version of ください.

/// When combined with other verbs, this verb may be used only when speaking to someone younger or to someone with less authority.

<br>

#### 気になる

/// When something is either annoying or worrisome to the speaker, he or she can express it with this idiomatic phrase:

<br>

彼の言ったことが気になる。//What he said was annoying.

母の健康が気になる。//I’m worried about my mother’s health.

<br>

#### ピンピンする

/// This onomatopoeia describes someone in good health.stage ３，６。

# Stage 3-6 Emotive Expressions

<br>

## 1: The Speaker’s vs. the Other’s Emotive Descriptions

### (1) Expressing emotions in Japanese

/// It has been stated previously that different structures must be used to express such things as desires and emotions of the speaker and of the third person.

<br>

/// There are common rules for all structures related to this issue; that is, describing emotions in the first person and the third person.

<br>

/// These common rules are:

/// - The structure that expresses the speaker’s emotions can also be used to ask a second person about their emotions directly.

/// - Emotions experienced by a third person can be stated by adding certain elements to the sentence structure that is used for the speaker. These will be summarized below.

<br>

#### Language of the writer and story-teller

/// The rules for emotive expressions for the first person and the third person often do not apply to stories and novels.

/// In novels, the following type of sentence is used often.

<br>

花子は嬉しかった。//Hanako was happy.

<br>

/// The topic is in the third person, but the predicate consists of an emotive adjective.

/// This is because writers and story-tellers in Japanese often use the language as if they were the speaker of the sentence, even when they use third-person pronouns or personal names.

/// It is important to distinguish such language uses from daily, real-life usage.

<br>

#### What about English?

/// English has no such restrictions on the use of emotive expressions.

/// In the following sentences, the emotive expressions used for first-person and third-person subjects are identical:

/// I am sad. He is sad. I want to go. He wants to go.

<br>

### (2) Expressing a third person’s emotions in Japanese

/// Several different structures have been introduced that may be used to express a third person’s emotive state.

/// Each of these expresses a different nuance.

/// For all examples below, consider the content of the emotive event, “the third person wants more time.”

<br>

/// First, the speaker can report by saying what the third person has told him or her:

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいと言っています。//He has been saying that he wants more time.

<br>

/// If the speaker directly observes that the third person obviously needs time, he or she can say:

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しそうです。//He looks as if he wants more time.

<br>

/// The following is similar to the sentence above.

/// The only difference is that in the sentence above, the need for time sounds urgent; in the sentence below it does not.

/// This sentence describes the speaker’s inference based on his or her direct observation, but it is expressed in more general terms:

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいようです。//He appears to want more time.

<br>

/// The next sentence reports information that the speaker has obtained from an objective source.

/// It is much like the first example, which reported what the third person said.

/// In the following sentence, the information source is not clear unless it is explicitly indicated.

### (In the sentence with 言う, of course, the information source is the third person, who has the feeling).

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいそうです。//I heard that he wants more time.

<br>

/// Sentences with らしい, like the following, are similar to the sentence with そうだ above.

/// The only slight difference is that the information source of the sentence with らしい is not totally objective.

/// The speaker acknowledges its validity.

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいらしいです。//He seems to want more time.

<br>

/// A sentence with はず indicates that the speaker expects his or her assessment of the third person’s emotion or desire to be true because there is some evidence to support it.

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいはずです。//I should think that he would want more time.

<br>

/// Of course, the speaker can also express a third person’s emotive state as his or her own opinion by using 思う.

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいと思います。//I believe that he would want more time.

<br>

/// In addition to the list above, there are still more ways to express a third person’s emotive state.

/// Some of these will be introduced below.

<br>

## 2: Adjective and Verb Pairs

/// Words that express emotions are not necessarily only adjectives.

/// There are some verbs that describe the topic’s emotions.

/// In fact, there are some adjective-verb pairs that have similar meanings, and in some cases, similar forms.

<br>

/// In terms of their uses, generally speaking, the speaker’s own desires and emotions are expressed with adjectives while those of the third person are expressed with verbs.

/// This does not mean, however, that emotive verbs are not used to describe the speaker’s emotions.

/// They are used for objective descriptions.

<br>

### (1) Examples of adjective and verb pairs

<br>

#### 嬉しい {うれしい} vs. 喜ぶ {よろこぶ}

<br>

私は試験に受かって、本当に嬉しいです。//I am very happy that I passed the test.

娘は試験に受かって、本当に喜んでいます。//My daughter is very happy that she passed the test.

<br>

/// This verb may be used to describe the speaker’s emotion objectively.

/// It is used often when the topic is plural and includes the speaker:

<br>

娘が試験に受かって、私達もとても喜んでいます。//We feel quite happy that our daughter passed the test.

<br>

#### 悲しい {かなしい} vs. 悲しむ {かなしむ}

<br>

僕はペットに死なれてしまって、本当に悲しいです。//I am very sad that my pet died.

妹はペットに死なれてしまって、本当に悲しんでいます。//My sister is very sad that her pet died.

<br>

/// The following example has a topic that includes the speaker:

<br>

妹も私もペットに死なれてしまって、本当に悲しんでいます。//Both my sister and I are very sad that our pet died.

<br>

#### 苦しい {くるしい} vs. 苦しむ {くるしむ}

<br>

私は熱が高くて、とても苦しいです。//I have a high fever, and I feel quite miserable.

彼は彼女と別れて、とても苦しんでいます。//He’s having a hard time being separated from his girlfriend.

<br>

/// The following example illustrates how a verb is used to describe a speaker’s emotion objectively.

<br>

彼と彼女が別れたことを聞いて、私もとても苦しんでいます。//I’m finding it difficult to accept their separation, too.

<br>

### (2) Topics of emotive adjectives and verbs

/// The difference between some emotive adjectives and verbs is the relation between the topic and the predicate.

/// With some emotive adjectives, the thing that the speaker has the feeling about may be the topic;

/// with emotive verbs, the person who feels must be the topic.

/// The following adjective and verb pair illustrates this difference.

<br>

#### 楽しい {たのしい} vs. 楽しむ {たのしむ}

/// In the sentence below with the adjective 楽しい, the feeling belongs to the speaker.

/// The topic is the thing about which the speaker feels something.

<br>

大学の生活は楽しいです。//For me, college life is fun.

<br>

/// With the verb 楽しむ “to enjoy,” the topic must be the person who feels:

<br>

友達は大学の生活を楽しんでいます。//My friend is enjoying life at college.

<br>

/// As explained above, with emotive verbs, the first person may be the topic,

/// but in this case, the emotive state is described rather objectively compared to verbs with emotive adjectives.

<br>

私は大学生活を楽しんでいます。//I’m enjoying life at college.

<br>

### (3) Emotive verbs to emotive nouns

/// The stems of emotive verbs can be used as emotive nouns.

<br>

/// - Meaning

/// sadness suffering happiness anger pleasure

/// - Verb

/// 悲しむ 苦しむ 喜ぶ 怒る 楽しむ

/// - Stem (Noun)

/// 悲しみ 苦しみ 喜び 怒り 楽しみ

<br>

/// The following section shows examples of some of these words.

<br>

#### Verbs

<br>

人間は喜んだり、悲しんだり、苦しんだりするとても複雑な動物です。//Human beings are complex animals that feel happiness, sadness, and suffering.

<br>

#### Stems

<br>

あの人は喜びも悲しみも苦しみも感じないのでしょうか。//Doesn’t he feel anything; happiness, sadness, or suffering?

<br>

## 3: From Adjectives to Verbs

/// Not all emotive adjectives have corresponding verbs.

/// In this case, there is a way to make an emotive adjective into an emotive verb.

/// The difference between emotive verbs and derived emotive verbs (formed by adding ~がる) is that,

/// unlike the emotive verbs explained above, the derived emotive verbs may not be used to describe the speaker’s emotions.

<br>

### (1) Suffix ~がる

/// The following rule shows how to derive emotive verbs from emotive adjectives.

/// [Drop い from the emotive adjective and add ~がる]

<br>

/// For instance, the verbal form of 欲しい is 欲しがる.

<br>

/// The following examples illustrate 欲しい for expressing desire in the first person and 欲しがる for expressing desire in the third person in two different aspects, habitual and current.

/// Notice the object marker が for the adjective and を for the verb.

<br>

私は新しい辞書が欲しいです。//I want a new dictionary.

<br>

/// ~ている in the sentence below expresses the current emotional state of the topic.

<br>

山田さんは新しい辞書を欲しがっています。//Yamada-san wants a new dictionary.

<br>

/// 欲しがる in the following sentence expresses a habitual aspect.

<br>

山田さんは私が持っている物は何でも欲しがります。//Yamada-san always wants what I have.

<br>

### (2) Even when there are pairs

/// The suffix ~がる may be used even when an adjective has a corresponding emotive verb.

<br>

#### Emotive verbs and ~がる verbs

/// The adjective 悲しい {かなしい} “sad” has a verbal counterpart, 悲しむ {かなしむ} “to become sad.”

/// This adjective may also be converted into a verb 悲しがる {かなしがる} “to be sad.”

<br>

/// What, then, is the difference between the emotive verbs and the ~がる emotive verbs?

/// As explained above, one difference is that the verb 悲しむ may be used for both the speaker’s and the third person’s emotions,

/// but the derived verb 悲しがる is used to describe only the third person’s emotions, not those of the speaker.

/// Another difference is that emotive verbs objectively describe the topic’s emotional state in rather general terms.

/// On the contrary, verbs derived from ~がる express a more immediate state based on the speaker’s direct observation.

<br>

山田さんは息子さんがアメリカに行ってしまって、悲しんでいます。//Yamada-san is sad because her son has gone to America.

山田さんは息子さんがアメリカに行ってしまって、悲しがっています。//I can tell that Yamada-san is sad because her son has gone to America.

<br>

#### ~がる verbs and stem + そう

/// Both the suffix ~がる and the complex adjectival noun with そう can be used to describe an immediate emotive state, based on the speaker’s direct observation.

<br>

/// What is the difference between these two structures?

/// The complex word with そう expresses an inference.

/// Therefore, in the first sentence below, the speaker really does not know that 山田さん is sad, although evidence suggests it.

/// The verb with ~がる indicates that the speaker actually knows that 山田さん is sad.

<br>

山田さんは息子さんがアメリカに行ってしまって、悲しそうです。//Yamada-san looks sad because her son has gone to America.

山田さんは息子さんがアメリカに行ってしまって、悲しがっています。//I know that Yamada-san is sad because her son has gone to America.

<br>

### (3) From derived adjectives to verbs

/// As previously explained, ~たい expresses the first person’s desire to do things.

/// From this derived adjective, a third person’s desire may be expressed by adding the suffix ~がる.

/// This changes the adjective to a verb:

/// たべる → たべたい → たべたがる;

/// する → したい → したがる;

/// くる → きたい → きたがる.

<br>

/// The following sentences show examples of this construction.

/// The second example illustrates the habitual aspect while the third one describes a current state.

<br>

私はアイスクリームが食べたいです。//I want to eat ice cream.

妹はいつもアイスクリームを食べたがります。//My sister always wants to eat ice cream.

妹はアイスクリームを食べたがっています。//My sister wants to eat ice cream right now.

<br>

## 4: Idiomatic Phrases with 気

/// In this section, some commonly used idiomatic phrases that include the noun 気 {き}, which literally means “mind” or “spirit,” will be introduced.

/// Some of these idiomatic phrases express emotions, and the restrictions on the use of these phrases are similar to those on the use of emotive adjectives and verbs.

/// Being able to use some idiomatic phrases adds variety and sophistication to the language level of the learner.

/// At the same time, it is a challenge to learn such phrases, as they are usually not governed by rules.

<br>

### (1) Emotive idiomatic phrases with 気 {き}

/// It is used to mean “to notice something.”

<br>

私はあの人が毎日、漢字を勉強していることに気がつきました。//I noticed that he studies kanji every day.

彼は私が毎日、漢字を勉強していることに全然、気がつきませんね。//He never even notices that I study kanji every day.

<br>

/// This idiomatic phrase can be condensed into the single verb 気づく.

<br>

私はあの人が毎日、漢字を勉強していることに気づきました。//I noticed that he studies kanji every day.

<br>

/// When the idiom 気がつく is used to describe a person, it means “to be considerate.”

<br>

あの人はよく気がつく人です。//That person is very considerate of others’ needs.

<br>

/// For this function, the condensed verb 気づく may not be used.

<br>

#### 気にする “to be concerned”

/// This expression means that the topic is worrying or is concerned about something.

多くの若者にとって、物がないということはとても苦しいことのようだ。//It seems to me that not having material things is painful to many young people.

<br>

/// The difference between the use of に and にとって is that the latter sounds a little more emphatic in singling out the person who experiences the emotion described.

/// Both に and にとって can be used with は and も, depending on the situation.

<br>

/// When the speaker wants to focus on the contrastive sense, then, は should be used.

/// In the sentence below, 日本人 is being singled out.

# Stage 3-7 Requests, Commands, and Imperatives

<br>

## 1: Imperative Forms and Sentences

### (1) Terms

/// The terms “request,” “command,” and “imperative” are very close in meaning.

/// The functions defined by these terms, and the structures that convey them, are only generally correlated;

/// there is really no definite one-to-one correspondence between them.

/// It is true that certain constructions are suitable for certain functions,

/// but in any language, different structures may be used for the same content, depending on the situation.

<br>

/// This chapter attempts to show that different structures may be used for a single function, and, likewise, that a single structure can be used for many different functions.

/// It is therefore very important to be able to recognize the importance of appropriate judgment in using the right structure for the right situation.

<br>

#### Making requests

/// In this, the term “request” is used when the speaker asks someone else to do something on his or her behalf.

/// Requests may be expressed by different types of sentences.

/// The following examples therefore are not exhaustive.

<br>

/// When requesting that the addressee do something for the speaker,

/// it is appropriate for the speaker to use ~てくださいませんか if the addressee is someone who is of a higher social status.

<br>

すみませんが、日曜日までにこの手紙を書いてくださいませんか。//I’m sorry to ask you this, but could you please write this letter by Sunday?

<br>

/// When asking the same thing of someone who is senior to the speaker, but only slightly so (e.g., a senpai in a social club),

/// then the following may be more appropriate:

<br>

すみませんが、日曜日までにこの手紙を書いてくれませんか。//I’m sorry to ask you this, but can you write this letter by Sunday?

<br>

/// For a request to a close friend, the use of ~てくれない in the rising tone is sufficient.

/// In this case, the use of すみませんが is too polite.

<br>

悪いけど、日曜日までにこの手紙を書いてくれない？//Sorry, but can you write this letter by Sunday?

<br>

/// A person may ask her or his friend to do something by using the て-form of a verb alone;

/// the use of the conjunctive form here does not have to be interpreted as a command, as one might expect, especially when some confirmation of the previous agreement is added.

/// Here the use of the sentence-final particle ね functions as confirmation.

<br>

悪いけど、日曜日までにこの手紙を書いてね。//Sorry, but I need you to write this by Sunday.

<br>

/// Although colloquial, ~てちょうだい may be used as a request from an authority figure to an addressee.

/// This expression is not as polite as ~てください and should not be used as a public command.

/// For instance, a mother speaking to a child may use this expression to make a request.

<br>

これ、ちょっと読んでちょうだい。//Read this for me.

<br>

/// Many other structures may be used to make requests, as well.

/// Other options will be presented in a later part of this chapter, when issues related to politeness are discussed.

<br>

#### Making commands

/// A “command” is used when an individual with greater authority tells the addressee what to do.

/// For instance, a teacher gives commands to his or her students, as shown below.

/// Even though the teacher is addressing children, she or he uses ください.

/// This indicates that this speech is made in a public place such as a school.

<br>

この宿題は来週、出してください。//Please submit this homework next week.

<br>

/// In a person-to-person interaction, even if it is a teacher speaking to a student, くださいmay be dropped.

/// For instance, when a teacher is explaining to a single student when assignments should be submitted, the following sentence may be used.

/// The speaker’s intent is conveyed through the sentence-final particle.

/// In the sentence below, the use of ね confirms the addressee’s understanding;

/// the use of よ suggests that the speaker wants to make sure that the addressee understands his or her duty.

<br>

この宿題は来週、出してね。//Submit this homework next week.

/// ね or よ

<br>

/// A stem with なさい may also be used to give a command (see Stage 2–6).

/// For instance, an elementary school teacher may give a command to a pupil using this construction.

/// This type of sentence can be used by a mother or a father to her or his child as well.

/// Depending on the situation and the tone used, this construction may be used to give an order or a strong command.

<br>

この宿題は来週、出しなさい。//Submit this homework next week.

<br>

/// The colloquial ~てちょうだい may also be used as a command in appropriate situations.

/// See above for an example.

<br>

#### Giving instructions

/// Giving instructions is a form of giving a command.

/// The only difference between the two is the position of the speaker.

/// When giving instructions, the speaker does not have to be someone who has authority, but is the person who has the information in a certain social setting.

/// For instance, a receptionist could give directions to a customer as follows:

<br>

こちらにお座りください。//Please sit here.

<br>

/// As pointed out in Stage 2–6, written instructions for a test, for instance, are expressed by a stem with なさい.

/// One may also see ~てください in such an instruction as well.

/// In this case, a stem with なさい lends a more authoritative ring to the instruction.

<br>

この言葉を漢字で書きなさい。//Write this word in kanji.

この言葉を漢字で書いてください。//Write this word in kanji.

<br>

/// For giving directions to a taxi driver, ~てください is common;

/// using a stem with なさい would be inappropriate.

<br>

/// As is the case for request sentences, many other structures may be used for commands and giving instructions.

/// These will be presented and summarized in a later part of this chapter, with a special focus on issues related to politeness.

<br>

### (2) Imperative forms

/// An imperative, a stronger form of command, is used when the speaker is ordering the addressee to do something in a very strong manner.

/// One way to express imperatives is by using imperative verb forms.

<br>

#### Positive imperative forms

/// The following chart shows the rules of deriving imperative forms from base forms.

/// Stative verbs such as ある and いる, some honorific verbs, and some intransitive counterparts of transitive-intransitive pairs lack imperative forms because of their meanings.

<br>

/// Group 1: Change る to ろ

///     くれる → くれ（ろ）; normally ろ is dropped for this verb.

/// Group 2: Change the last u to e

/// Group 3: する → しろ, くる → こい

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: たべる → たべろ, みる → みろ

/// G2: かく → かけ, はなす → はなせ, かう → かえ

<br>

#### Negative imperatives

/// The negative imperative forms are made by adding な to the positive imperfective form.

/// たべるな, のむな, いくな, するな, くるな

<br>

### (3) Direct imperatives

/// When an imperative form is used alone to make a direct order, the expression sounds extremely harsh and direct.

/// Only a limited number of situations allow such a use.

/// An example could be when a senior member, most likely male, of a sports club is training a junior member:

<br>

走れ！//Run!

止まるな！//Don’t stop!

<br>

/// An older brother might say to his little brother:

<br>

黙れ！//Be quiet!

泣くな！//Don’t cry!

<br>

/// When a sentence-final particle is added to the imperative forms, the expression may not sound so harsh, especially with a falling intonation.

/// With a harsher tone of voice, the sentence could still sound quite rude and punitive.

/// In either case, however, this is used only by male speakers.

<br>

だれにも言うなよ。//Don’t tell anyone this.

食べろよ。//Eat, will you?

<br>

/// What would a female speaker say in these situations?

/// For positive imperatives, using ~て alone or ~ てちょうだい, and for negative imperatives, using ~ないで or ~ないでちょうだい with appropriate sentence-final particles is common.

<br>

黙って（ちょうだい）！//Be quiet!

泣かないで（ちょうだい）！//Don’t cry!

<br>

#### Fixed expressions

/// Some fixed expressions in the imperative form may be used by both genders.

/// The following expression is used to give encouragement, not an order.

/// It may be repeated for emphasis.

<br>

頑張れ！頑張れ！//You can do it!

/// or “Good luck!

<br>

/// The same content can be expressed by the て-form alone as well.

/// The following expression sounds a little milder than the one with the imperative form.

<br>

頑張って！//You can do it!

/// or “Good luck!”

<br>

### (4) Embedded imperative forms

/// Embedded imperative forms are often used to convey what someone was told by someone else.

/// For example, they may be used to express how the speaker was told to do or not do certain things.

/// In such a situation, what the speaker was told can be expressed with the imperative form, even if the imperative form was not actually used in the original statement.

/// Gender need not be considered when imperative forms are used in embedded clauses.

<br>

僕は父に早く帰れと言われました。//My father said to come home soon.

/// Literally, “I was told by my father to come home soon.”

<br>

私はいつも母にそんなに急いで食べるなと言われます。//My mother always tells me not to eat so fast.

/// Literally, “I am always told by my mother not to eat in a hurry.”

<br>

### (5) Imperfective verbs with ように

/// Sentences containing the imperative form of a verb, even within embedded clauses, may still sound quite direct and strong.

/// For a softer approach, the following construction with ように may be used.

/// The verb preceding ように must be in the imperfective form.

<br>

#### With positive verbs

<br>

大きな声で話すように言われました。//I was told to speak loudly.

来月までに終えるように頼まれました。//I was asked to finish it by next month.

<br>

#### With negative verbs

<br>

森さんに来年まで退職しないように言っておきました。//I told Mori-san not to retire until next year.

日本語の勉強を諦めないように言ってください。//Please tell him not to give up on his Japanese studies.

<br>

## 2: Structures for Giving Commands

/// In the above section, it was shown that a certain function, such as a “command,” can be expressed by different structures.

/// In this section, several different functions for which a single structure may be used will be presented.

/// Typical structures for giving a command, such as ~て（ください） and ~て（ち ょうだい）, will not be included here.

<br>

### (1) Stem + なさい

<br>

#### Giving commands to children

/// As explained above, the stem with なさい is used to give a direct command;

/// it is often used by parents to their children, older siblings to younger siblings, or by teachers, especially those of younger children, to their pupils.

<br>

早く寝なさい。//Go to bed early.

もっと、野菜を食べなさい。//Eat more vegetables.

<br>

#### Giving instructions

/// The stem with なさい is also used to give written instructions, especially in tests and examinations.

<br>

この文を日本語に訳しなさい。//Translate this sentence into Japanese.

<br>

/// For other instructions, such as those written in manuals or driving directions, this construction is not suitable.

/// ~てください is better to use for these purposes.

<br>

### (2) ~てはいけない（だめ）

<br>

#### Prohibition

/// The stem with なさい has no negative counterpart.

/// To express this concept, one of the previously introduced constructions used for prohibition, ~てはいけない or ~てはだめ, may be used.

<br>

ここで走っては、いけません。//Running is not allowed here.

ここで走っては、だめです。//It’s not a good idea to run here.

<br>

/// Of course, a negative command, both polite and casual, with ないで is also possible:

<br>

ここで走らないでください。//Please don’t run here.

ここで走らないで。//Don’t run here.

<br>

#### Casual speech, ~ちゃいけない（だめ）

/// Speech tends to be casual when children are being addressed.

/// In casual speech, many things that are not heard in formal speech may surface.

/// For instance, sentence-final particles are used much more frequently; these particles may differ depending on the speaker’s gender.

/// Predicate endings may also differ based on gender.

/// In addition, more contractions may occur in casual speech.

<br>

/// For instance, the following contractions were introduced in the Conversational Devices section of Stages 2–7 and 2–8:

/// ~てしまう → ~ちゃう, ~ておく → ~とく, and ~なければ → ~なきゃ.

<br>

忘れちゃった。//I totally forgot it.

ちゃんと買っとくから、心配しないで。//I’ll buy them, don’t worry.

宿題しなきゃ。//I have to do my homework.

<br>

/// In prohibitions, the ~ては of ~てはいけない or ~てはだめ (as well as other uses of ~ては) is contracted to ~ちゃ in casual speech.

<br>

そんなこと、言っちゃ、だめ。//You shouldn’t say things like that.

<br>

#### Advice for children

/// The colloquial constructions ~ちゃいけない（だめ） may be used by an adult to give advice or suggestions to children.

/// The use of the copula at the end of the sentence is limited to male speakers.

<br>

授業、休んじゃ、だめだよ。//It’s not good to skip school; you know that, don’t you.

<br>

/// A female speaker would say the sentence above without the copula.

<br>

授業、休んじゃ、だめよ。//It’s not good to skip school; you know that, don’t you.

嘘、ついちゃ、だめよ。//You shouldn’t tell lies.

/// Literally, “It’s not good to tell lies.”

<br>

### (3) お + stem

/// Orders using the honorific お with the stem are often given to animals.

お座り！//Sit!

<br>

/// Sometimes a much older person may give such a command to a much younger person,

/// but this usage is extremely restricted, and is used only by a certain type of person.

/// When this kind of construction is used, the speaker is either quite irritated or not very refined.

<br>

お食べ！//Eat!

お行き！//Go!

<br>

#### Fixed expressions

/// Included in any construction are fixed expressions that may not carry all of the implications or meanings of the original construction;

/// the following command is one of these.

/// Most fixed phrases may be used with fewer restrictions.

/// The following command may be given by an adult to a child, for example, and it does not sound as harsh as those above.

<br>

お出で！//Come this way!

<br>

/// The fixed expression above comes from an honorific verb, お出（い）でになる.

/// This honorific verb is for both 行く and 来る, and お出（い）でになる is more honorific than the honorific いらっしゃる.

/// Because it is a fixed expression, however, the honorific implications are not conveyed in the expression above,

/// except in that it is less harsh than others using the same structure.

<br>

## 3: Indirect Commands

/// Commands can be expressed directly or indirectly. The constructions discussed above are direct commands.

/// Commands can also be implied in some sentences. Some ways to express commands indirectly are introduced below.

<br>

### (1) Complex predicates with ものだ

<br>

#### もの as a noun

/// The noun 物 {もの} refers to tangible things or concepts (when used for concepts, もの is not normally written in kanji).

/// こと is often contrasted with 物, as both are translated as “things.”

/// For the difference between こと and 物, see Stage 2–2.

/// In the following sentences, the first 物 refers to a tangible thing, while the second もの refers to a concept.



あの大きい物は何ですか。//What is that big thing?

言葉というものは難しいものだ。//What we call language is a very difficult thing.

<br>

#### Complex predicates with positive imperfectives

/// もの is also used as a functional noun in the complex predicate ものだ.

/// In this case, もの is not written in kanji.

/// This complex predicate expresses commonly expected modes of behavior (such as customs in a certain country).

/// Although the nuance is not as strong as a direct command or imperative, it still indicates a strong expectation.

<br>

/// A construction with a positive imperfective predicate before ものだ is used to convey behavior that the speaker believes is dictated by common sense.

<br>

人を訪ねる時は、いつもお土産を持っていくものだ。//When you visit someone, you should always bring a gift with you.

人から物をもらった時には、きちんとお礼を言うものです。//When you receive something from someone, you should politely thank him.

<br>

#### Complex predicates with negative imperfectives

/// Either the copula or the verb immediately before ものだ may be negated.

/// By negating the copula, the speaker is pointing out the undesirable action that he or she has observed, thereby conveying the message that it should not be repeated.

<br>

そんな失礼なことを言うものではありません。//You shouldn’t say those kinds of rude things.

/// I.e., the person has made the rude statement already.

<br>

/// When the verb before ものだ is in the negative form, the speaker expects that the action will not take place.

<br>

親切にしてもらったら、文句を言わないものです。//Don’t complain when receiving such kindness.

/// I.e., the addressee is expected not to complain.

<br>

### (2) Different meanings with positive perfectives

/// Indirect commands must be expressed with imperfectives.

/// If a perfective is used in the predicate before ものだ, the implication of an indirect command is absent.

/// Instead, the construction indicates that the action referred to is something the speaker used to do in the past.

<br>

僕はこの店でよくコーヒーを飲んだものだ。//I often used to drink coffee at this store.

子供の時、私はよくこの公園で遊んだものだった。//When I was a child, I used to play in this park.

<br>

/// The difference between the imperfective copula だ and perfective copula だった is slight.

/// The nuance that the event occurred quite a while ago is emphasized much more with だった,

/// but this is really a matter of the speaker’s or writer’s perspective.

<br>

### (3) Complex predicates with べきだ

/// The complex predicate with べきだ expresses a strong obligation.

/// The use of べきだ in a complex predicate sounds very objective and impersonal compared with something like ~なければならない.

/// Because of this nuance, it is often used to talk about social expectations or obligations.

/// Note that the complex predicate with ものだ lacks the meaning of obligation.

<br>

先生に謝るべきです。//You should apologize to the teacher.

退職するべきです。//You should retire.

<br>

/// Negatives are only expressed in the copula, not in the predicate before べきだ.

<br>

どんなことがあっても、諦めるべきでは（じゃ）ありません。//One should never give up, no matter what.

<br>

#### Controversial acts

/// The negative perfective of the copula in this construction can be used to indicate that a person has committed a controversial act.

/// The speaker judges that the act, which has already happened, should never have taken place.

<br>

あの人はこんな手紙を書くべきでは（じゃ）ありませんでした。//He really shouldn’t have written this kind of letter.

<br>

## 4: Politeness Levels of Requests and Commands

/// Many structures can be used to express requests and commands.

/// In this section, they are summarized according to their level of politeness.

<br>

### (1) Requests

<br>

#### ~てくださいませんか

/// ~てくださいませんか is one of the most typical constructions introduced as a way to make requests.

/// As explained earlier, the sentence below may be used to request something of your teacher, a senior, or an older non-family member whom you are expected to respect.

<br>

推薦状を書いてくださいませんか。//Can you please write me a recommendation letter?

<br>

#### ~てもらえませんか and ~ていただけませんか

/// もらえる and いただける in these constructions are the potential forms of もらう and いただく.

/// When these verbs are used to make requests, they should be used in the negative.

/// The literal meaning of this construction is something like “Wouldn’t it be possible for me to receive your doing such-and-such for me?”

/// Because of this circumlocution, these requests are much more polite than the one above.

/// They can be used to make requests of the same people addressed with ~てくださいませんか; these structures are simply more polite.

<br>

推薦状を書いてもらえませんか。//Could you please write me a recommendation letter?

<br>

/// Since いただく is the humble form of もらう, using this verb makes the expression even more polite than one with もらう:

<br>

推薦状を書いていただけませんか。//Would it be possible for you to write a recommendation letter for me?

<br>

/// Even more indirect, and thus more polite, is the use of the volitional copula でしょう, as in the following:

<br>

推薦状を書いてもらえないでしょうか。//Do you think it might be possible for you to write me a recommendation letter?

推薦状を書いていただけないでしょうか。//Do you think it might be possible for you to write a recommendation letter for me?

<br>

/// Further politeness can be obtained by changing もらえない and いただけない before でしょうか into the polite forms.

<br>

推薦状を書いてもらえませんでしょうか。//Is there any way that you might write me a recommendation letter?

推薦状を書いていただけませんでしょうか。//Is there any way that you might write a recommendation letter for me?

<br>

#### Casual direct request with ~てくれる？~てくれない？

/// All of the above may be changed into the plain predicates.

/// These sentences may be used for making casual requests of friends or acquaintances.

/// When the negative form is used, it is more indirect, and thus more polite, than the positive ending.

<br>

これ、読んでくれる？//Can you read this for me?

これ、読んでくれない？//Could you read this for me?

<br>

#### Casual indirect request with ~てもらえない？ ~ていただけない？

/// Even though the expression is still casual, the use of the potential with the receiving verbs もらう and いただく is more indirect and polite.

/// The use of いただく is more polite than もらう.

<br>

これ、読んでもらえない？//Could you please read this for me?

これ、読んでいただけない？//Could you please read this for me?

<br>

#### ~てちょうだい

/// The colloquial spoken form ~てちょうだい may be used to ask children or others with less power to do something for the speaker.

/// On the politeness scale, this structure may be the most casual, at least of those compared in this section.

<br>

ちょっと、手伝ってちょうだい。//Give me a hand for a moment, will you?

<br>

### (2) Commands

/// In all cases, regardless of its politeness level, a command is given from a person with more power to one with less power;

/// for instance, from a teacher to a student or from a senior member to a junior member of a group.

<br>

#### Polite command with ~てください

/// Polite commands are used in more public situations, such as in a high school or a college classroom.

<br>

静かにしてください。//Please be quiet.

<br>

#### Casual command with ~て

/// ください may be deleted when speaking to children or in a less formal situation.

<br>

ほら、静かにして。//Be quiet, you guys.

<br>

#### Stem + なさい

/// This construction is often used to give commands to children or to students.

<br>

静かにしなさい。//Be quiet.

<br>

### (3) Giving instructions

<br>

#### お + stem + ください

/// A store clerk might use the following structure to tell a customer how to fill out an application form:

<br>

こちらにお名前とご住所をお書きください。//Write your name and address here.

こちらでお待ちください。//Please wait here.

<br>

#### The use of ませ

/// In the above cases, ませ may be added to make the instructions more polite.

<br>

こちらにお名前とご住所をお書きくださいませ。//Please write your name and address here.

こちらでお待ちくださいませ。//Please wait here.

<br>

#### Stem + なさい (written instructions)

<br>

これを日本語に訳しなさい。//Translate this into Japanese.

下線部を漢字に書きかえなさい。//Write the underlined parts in kanji.

<br>

/// Endings such as ませ are never used for test instructions, but ~てください may be used.

<br>

<br>

#### うるさい

<br>

#### おじさん

/// Family terms such as おじさん, おばさん, おじいさん, and おばあさん may be used to address strangers.

/// These terms may sound insulting to some individuals who are age-sensitive.

/// It is difficult to give definite guidelines as to when these terms are better avoided,

# Stage 3-8 Overriding Particles

<br>

## 1: The Overriding Particle こそ

<br>

### (1) Overriding particles

/// Recall that there are three kinds of particles:

/// 1. linking particles, which connect two elements such as a noun and a predicate, or a noun and another noun (e.g., が, を, の);

/// 2. sentence-final particles, which are placed at the end of sentences to show what type of sentence it is (e.g., か, よ, ね);

/// 3. overriding particles, which add other meanings to the original particles (e.g., は, も, だけ).

<br>

/// This chapter will introduce additional overriding particles.

<br>

### (2) こそ with a positive predicate

/// こそ indicates that, to the speaker, the preceding noun is the ultimate one in its category.

/// Here the term “highlighting” is used to indicate this function.

<br>

#### こそ with a noun

/// If the speaker believes that an ideal teacher possesses a certain quality, and, consequently, that Tanaka-sensei has that exact quality,

/// Tanaka-sensei could be highlighted as in the following statement:

<br>

田中先生こそ私が理想としている先生です。//I consider Tanaka-sensei to be the ideal teacher.

<br>

/// A noun phrase marked by こそ has a meaning similar to one marked with が, which puts emphasis on the topic.

/// The difference between が and こそ is that が can be used only for the topic that is being emphasized, but こそ may be used in other parts of a sentence (e.g., the object position).

/// In the following sentence, 日本に留学すること is actually the object of 楽しみにする.

/// When こそ is used, it is usually placed at the beginning of a sentence.

<br>

日本に留学することこそ、私が一番、楽しみにしていたことだ。//What I’ve been looking forward to, above all, is studying abroad in Japan.

<br>

#### こそ in the predicate

/// こそ may highlight an entire clause, rather than just a noun or noun phrase:

<br>

学生のことを思っているからこそ、たくさん勉強させているのです。//I’m making my students study a lot precisely because I care about them.

勉強は、努力してこそ、意味があるものなのです。//Studying has meaning only when you make an effort.

<br>

#### Fixed expressions

/// The expression こちらこそ was introduced in the Preparatory Stage as a way to respond to an expression of thanks or an apology.

/// For instance, suppose that someone offered the following apology to the speaker:

<br>

本当にすみませんでした。//I’m really sorry.

<br>

/// The speaker could then respond by saying.

<br>

いいえ。こちらこそ。//No, I’m the one (who should apologize).

<br>

/// こそ is used here because the speaker believes that he or she, referred to as こちら, is, above all, the one who should apologize.

<br>

### (3) こそ with a negative predicate

/// A noun modified by こそ in a sentence with a negative predicate is highlighted as an ultimate possible event or condition that did not take place.

/// In this case, the second clause normally indicates that the situation is not bad, despite the fact that the condition has not been realized.

<br>

/// The following example implies that ideally speaking, the book would be published,

/// but the negative predicate indicates that in reality it has not been,

/// but the quality of the book is superb despite this negative condition.

<br>

この本は出版こそされていないが、素晴らしい書物だと思う。//It hasn’t been published, but I think it’s a wonderful book.

<br>

/// The next example expresses that while having money is ideal, this is a condition that has not been met;

/// however, this negative situation has not had a serious effect on the speaker’s life.

<br>

お金こそないが、幸せな生活をしている。//I don’t have money, but my life is quite happy.

<br>

## 2: The Overriding Particle さえ

/// When a noun is followed by the particle さえ, it indicates that it is the least likely thing, person, or event the speaker can imagine in a certain situation.

<br>

### (1) さえ with a negative predicate

/// Because of the meaning that noun phrases with さえ convey, sentences with さえ are often in the negative.

<br>

/// Suppose the speaker cooked something that did not turn out well.

/// The speaker knows that the last person who would complain about such a thing is Mori-san.

/// In the following sentence, さえ expresses that even Mori-san, who would normally eat just about anything, did not eat the food the speaker cooked.

<br>

森さんさえ私の料理に手をつけなかった。//Even Mori-san didn’t touch the food I cooked.

<br>

#### さえ with numbers

/// さえ is often used to indicate the least possible amount.

/// Suppose the speaker wants to express that she or he has no money, the following sentence may be used to express this situation.

<br>

一セントさえ持っていなかった。//I had no money, not even a cent.

<br>

/// The overriding particle も with a negative predicate conveys a similar meaning.

<br>

一セントも持っていなかった。//I didn’t have a cent.

<br>

/// In fact, さえ and も may be combined to emphasize the severity of the situation:

<br>

一セントさえも持っていなかった。//I didn’t have a single cent.

<br>

#### も and さえ

/// Although sentences with も and さえ may convey similar meanings,

/// this does not mean that も and さえ have the same meaning and are thus interchangeable.

/// In fact, they differ slightly in nuance.

/// In the following examples, both も and さえ indicate that people other than Mori-san did not touch the food.

/// The sentence with さえ, however, implies that the speaker expected that at least Mori-san would eat the food,

/// but even this minimum requirement was not fulfilled.

/// Such an assumption is lacking with も. The use of も simply indicates that Mori-san was not an exception.

<br>

森さんさえ私の料理に手をつけなかった。//Even Mori-san didn’t touch the food I cooked.

森さんも私の料理に手をつけなかった。//Mori-san didn’t touch the food I cooked, either.

<br>

### (2) さえ with a positive predicate

/// A noun phrase marked by さえ indicates that this is the least expected person or thing to do something.

/// Suppose the speaker is a comedian, and everyone laughed during his or her performance.

<br>

/// The sentence below indicates that Mori-san is the last person that anyone expected to laugh, and even he or she laughed at the performance.

<br>

森さんさえ笑ってくれた。//Even Mori-san laughed.

<br>

#### さえ with a conditional predicate

/// When used in general statements containing a positive predicate, さえ often accompanies a conditional adverbial clause.

<br>

/// Suppose that the speaker’s minimum requirement for a meal is that there be rice.

<br>

ご飯さえあれば、食事は何でもいい。//As long as there’s rice, anything will make a meal.

ご飯さえあったら、食事は何でもいい。//As long as there’s rice, anything will make a meal.

<br>

/// If the speaker believes that practicing every day is what is minimally necessary to be good at Japanese, then she or he can say the following:

<br>

毎日、練習さえしていれば、日本語は上手になる。//If you at least practice every day, you’ll get good at Japanese.

<br>

#### すら

/// すら is a particle that is very similar to さえ in usage, especially in negative sentences.

/// すら is used more in formal writing and speech, whereas さえ is used for both colloquial and formal writing and speech.

<br>

一セントすら持っていなかった。//I didn’t have a single cent.

<br>

## 3: The Overriding Particle ばかり

/// When ばかり precedes a noun, the phrase indicates that that is the only thing or person that will do or did the action.

<br>

森さんばかり話していた。//Mori-san was the only one talking.

/// I.e., other people did not have a chance to speak.

<br>

/// The overriding particle だけ expresses a similar meaning.

<br>

森さんだけ話していた。//Only Mori-san was talking.

<br>

/// The above sentence with だけ expresses the event as one incident;

/// it is not clear if others wanted to speak.

/// Using ばかり implies that every time the occasion arose to speak, it was Mori who spoke, and he or she did not give others a chance to speak.

<br>

/// Compare the following sentences in which ばかり and だけ are used for the direct objects.

<br>

あの人は野菜ばかり食べる。//All he eats is vegetables.

あの人は野菜だけ食べる。//He will only eat vegetables.

<br>

/// When だけ is used, the sentence says that among the choices that the topic has, he or she chooses only vegetables.

/// This sentence does not imply that this happens every time that the topic eats, which is the implication expressed by ばかり.

<br>

### (2) Complex predicates with ばかりだ

/// When ばかりだ is used in complex predicates, the aspect of the verb before ばかり conveys a specific meaning.

<br>

#### With the positive imperfective form

/// When the verb before ばかりだ is imperfective, ばかり singles the verb out as the only action that the topic will do or does.

<br>

/// In the following sentence, the use of the imperfective before ばかりだ indicates that writing the paper still remains to be completed.

<br>

卒業までに後はこのレポートを書くばかりです。//The only thing left to do before graduation is to write this paper.

<br>

/// The following example indicates that in the past, the student has just had fun and never studied, and implies that this behavior is habitual.

<br>

あの学生は遊ぶばかりで、全然、勉強をしない。//That student just goofs off and doesn’t study at all.

<br>

/// In either case, however, one action is being singled out.

<br>

#### With the positive perfective form

/// When the verb before ばかりだ is in the perfective, the sentence means that the action was completed recently.

<br>

祖母は退院したばかりです。//My grandmother was discharged from the hospital just a little while ago.

<br>

/// This usage of ばかりだ is very similar to the use of complex predicates with ところだ.

/// The difference between the two will be discussed in the following section.

<br>

### (3) Difference between ところだ and ばかりだ

/// Complex predicates with ばかりだ and ところだ are quite similar, especially when the verb is in the perfective form.

/// Sentences with ところだ assume that no time has passed between the completion of an event and the time of speaking,

/// while those with ばかりだ indicate that the event was completed recently,

/// so a short period of time may have passed between the completion of an event and the time of speaking.

<br>

/// In the following examples, because of these meaning differences,

/// the sentence with ところだ might be used on the day of the wedding,

/// while the one with ばかりだ would be used after a short period of time has passed.

<br>

兄は結婚したところです。//My brother just got married.

兄は結婚したばかりです。//My brother just got married.

<br>

/// The following example indicates that the time between when the computer was bought and when it broke was short:

<br>

このコンピュータは、買ったばかりなのに、もう壊れてしまった。//We just bought this computer, but it’s already broken.

<br>

/// In this case, the use of ところだ is inappropriate because the sentence with ところだ indicates that the action of buying was only just completed.

<br>

### (4) Fixed expressions with ばかりじゃなく ~ も

/// The expression ばかりじゃ（or では）なく and も means something similar to “not only . . . but also . . .”

/// The first part may be ばかりではなく, ばかりでなく, or ばかりじゃなく, in order from most to least formal:

<br>

あの人はきれいなばかりではなく、頭もとてもいい。//Not only is she pretty, but she is also very smart.

あの人はほとんど何も食べないばかりでなく、水も飲まない。//Not only is he not eating, but he’s not even drinking water.

外国語は話すことが難しいばかりじゃなく、書くこともとても難しい。//Not only is speaking in a foreign language difficult, but writing is, as well.

<br>

### (5) ばかり with numbers

/// ばかり can also be used after numbers, indicating that the number is approximate.

/// This is similar to the use of ぐらい.

/// The difference is that ばかり has the combined meaning of “only” and “approximately” whereas ぐらい indicates only approximation.

/// Because of this meaning, the number with ば かり gives the sense that the number mentioned is a small amount, at least to the speaker.

<br>

二分ばかり待っていたら、田村さんが来た。//I only waited for Tamura-san for about two minutes, and then he came.

<br>

## 4: Complex Predicates with だけだ

/// The overriding particle だけ is also used in complex predicates.

<br>

### (1) With the imperfective form

/// When the verb used immediately before だけ is in the imperfective form,

/// the structure indicates that the only thing to be done is what the verb indicates:

<br>

旅行の準備は全部した。後は、母に電話をするだけだ。//I’ve done everything in preparation for the trip. The only thing left to do is to call my mother.

<br>

/// The verb before だけ may also be nominalized by こと, as in the following:

<br>

旅行の準備は全部した。後は、母に電話をすることだけだ。//I’ve done everything in preparation for the trip. Now I just have to call my mother.

<br>

/// The difference between the verb with こと and without it is very slight, especially when only one verb is used.

/// Using こと allows more than one verb to be listed in the sentence, however.

<br>

旅行の準備は全部した。後は、母に電話をすることと銀行に行くことだけだ。//I’ve done everything in preparation for the trip. Now I just have to call my mother and go to the bank.

<br>

### (2) With the perfective form

/// When the verb used immediately before だけ is in the perfective form,

/// the structure indicates that the only thing the topic did is what the verb indicates:

<br>

スミスさんに宿題の漢字を教えてあげただけなのに、お礼にと言って、高いコンサートの切符を送ってくれた。//All I did was to help Smith-san with the kanji in her assignment; she gave me an expensive concert ticket in return.

彼に頼んだのに、彼は黙って、向こうに行っただけだった。//I asked him, but he just left without saying a word.

<br>

#### The difference between だけだ and ばかりだ

/// Complex predicates with だけだ and ばかりだ are similar when the verb that precedes them is in the imperfective.

/// With だけだ, the meaning focus is that the only action the topic takes is to respond.

/// When ばかりだ is used, it is possible to interpret the sentence as meaning that each time someone asks, the topic responds.

<br>

あの人は返事をするだけで、後は何もしない。//When asked, all he does is respond; he never does anything.

あの人は返事をするばかりで、後は何もしない。//Whenever he is asked, all he does is respond; he never does anything.

<br>

### (1) Promise

<br>

森君、来ませんねえ。約束の時間を間違えたんでしょうか。//Mori-kun isn’t here yet. I wonder if he got the appointment time wrong.

森君にかぎって、そんなことはありませんよ。昨日、ちゃんと覚えてましたよ。もうすぐ、来るんじゃないでしょうか。//He wouldn’t do something like that. He remembered it yesterday. I’m sure he’ll be here soon.

<br>

#### 森君にかぎって、そんなことはありませんよ

/// かぎって comes from the verb 限（かぎ）る “to limit.”

/// Used adverbially, this entire sentence means “Mori-kun won’t do something like that,”

/// and 森君にかぎって expresses the notion that “of all people, it would never be Mori-kun who . . .”

<br>

#### 来るんじゃないでしょうか

/// This sentence means “He’ll probably come soon”;

/// literally, “Isn’t it the case that he will come?”

<br>

### (3) Perfect timing

<br>

今から、食事なんですか。僕、ちょうどいいところに来ましたねえ。//Are you eating now? I came at the right time, didn’t I?

ちゃっかりしてるんだなあ。//Oh! You’re shameless!

<br>

#### ちょうどいいところに

/// ところ here does not refer to a physical place.

/// It refers to a “place in time.”

<br>

#### ちゃっかりする

/// It may be impossible to capture the concept of this phrase with a single word in English,

/// but it refers to the following kind of behavior:

/// when a person easily or readily takes advantage of the other person’s work,

/// then that kind of behavior is expressed as ちゃっかりする.

### (4) Polite apologies

<br>

先日は申し訳ございませんでした。//I’m so sorry about the other day.

いいえ、とんでもございません。こちらこそ失礼致しました。//Oh, no, not at all. I’m the one who should apologize.

<br>

#### 先日

/// This is a more formal version of この間（あいだ）, “the other day.”

<br>

#### 申し訳ございません

/// 申し訳 {もうしわけ} means “excuse”;

/// 申し訳ありません literally means that “I have no excuse,” and thus the expression is used to express an apology.

/// 申し訳ございません is more polite than 申し訳ありません, which was introduced in Stage 2–3.

<br>

#### とんでもございません

/// This is a very polite way of responding when someone offers thanks or an apology.

/// This expression means something like “there is no need to thank me/apologize to me.”

/// Even when ありません is used instead of ございません as in とんでもありません, the expression is still quite formal.
