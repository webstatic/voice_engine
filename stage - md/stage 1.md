# Stage 1-1 Basic Structures of Japanese

<br>

## 1: Topic and Comment

### (1) Schematic composition of the basic sentence

/// sentence -> [TOPIC,COMMENT]

/// COMMENT -> [Subject,WHOLE PREDICATE]

/// WHOLE PREDICATE -> [Object,CORE PREDICATE]

/// CORE PREDICATE -> [Nominal predicate | Adjectival predicate | Verbal predicate]

<br>

/// The basic structure of a Japanese sentence consists of the topic and the comment, which serve as the foundation for longer and more complex sentences.

/// The topic is described in the comment; within the comment, the subject is described in the predicate.

<br>

### (2) Particles

/// are used after a noun or noun phrase, between nouns or noun phrases, or at the end of a sentence.

/// A noun is a word that refers to a person, a thing, a place, a concept, etc.;

/// a noun phrase is a noun with other modifying or added elements.

<br>

/// A particle essentially provides the preceding noun, noun phrase, or sentence with a function in the sentence.

<br>

/// There are three kinds of particles in Japanese: linking particles, sentence-final particles, overriding particles

/// linking particles, which link the preceding noun or noun phrase to the predicate or noun/noun phrase that follows it;

/// sentence-final particles, which are used at the end of sentences and indicate the speaker’s intent, view, interpretation, etc.;

/// overriding particles, which add further meaning to the existing particles.

<br>

#### The topic particle は (overriding particle)

/// whatever the speaker chooses to speak about or to pose a question about can be brought to the topic position in a sentence by marking it with the particle は.

/// the topic of a sentence in Japanese is made up of a noun or a noun phrase, and is indicated by the topic particle は.

<br>

#### Question particle か and confirmation particle ねえ (sentence-final particle)

/// か is used for question sentences while ねえ is used to confirm the speaker’s understanding or reaction with the addressee.

<br>

分かりますか。//Do you understand?

今日は暑いですねえ。//It’s hot today, isn’t it

<br>

#### Descriptive particle な (linking particle)

/// is used between two nouns.

<br>

今日はいやな天気ですねえ。//Terrible weather today, isn’t it?

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Predicates

### (1) The three types of predicate

/// The use of a subject and an object depends on the kind of predicate used in the sentence.

/// There are three possible predicate types in Japanese: the nominal predicate, the adjectival predicate, and the verbal predicate.

/// all predicates come at the end of the sentence

<br>

### (2) Nominal predicates - consists of a noun and the copula です.

<br>

私はずんだもんです。//I am Zundamon.

こちらはずんだもんさんです。//This is Zundamon-san.

<br>

#### The copula です

/// is similar to, but not the same as, the linking verb “be”

/// Another function of です is to indicate that the sentence is in the polite style.

<br>

### (3) Adjectival predicates - consists of an adjective and です.

/// Adjectives are a class of words that describe things, people, etc.

<br>

今日は寒いです。//It’s cold today.

今日は暑いです。//It’s hot today.

<br>

#### Adverbs

/// are words that modify adjectives, verbs, and other adverbs.

/// They normally express such concepts as quality, quantity, degree, or manner and are normally placed immediately before the words they modify.

<br>

今日は本当に寒いです。//It’s really cold today.

今日はとても暑いです。//It’s very hot today.

<br>

/// There are other kinds of adverbs that modify entire sentences.  One example is the time adverb

<br>

今日、日本はとても暑いです。//It’s very hot in Japan today.

<br>

### (4) Verbal predicates

<br>

分かりますか。//Do you understand?

ええ、よく分かります。//Yes, I understand well.

ずんだもんさんは分かりますか。//Do you understand, Zundamon-san?

ええ、（私は）よく分かります。//Yes, I understand well.

<br>

/// When the speaker judges that the addressee would know the referent, it is often deleted in Japanese. The referent can be the topic, the object, or some other noun or noun phrase in the sentence.

<br>

#### The direct object and the particle が (linking particle)

/// The particle が is used after a certain kind of direct object to indicate that the preceding noun is the direct object of the predicate

/// In Japanese, the direct object must be placed before the predicate.

<br>

ナースロボさんは日本語がよく分かります。//Naasurobo-san understands Japanese well.

<br>

#### The direct object and the particle を (linking particle)

/// を (pronounced “o” in modern Japanese when used in this way).

/// を is used for the direct object of an action predicate

/// が marks the direct object of a non-action predicate

<br>

私は日本語を勉強します。//I will study Japanese.

<br>

/// The directional particles に and へ (linking particles)

/// The destination of the movement is indicated by either the particle に or へ (へ is pronounced “e” only when it is used as a particle).

<br>

僕は日本に行きます。//I will go to Japan.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Pronouns

### (1) First-person

/// Choosing an appropriate pronoun depends on factors such as the gender of the speaker and addressee, the speech situation, and the region in which these pronouns are used, among others.

/// both 私 {わたくし}, the most formal first-person pronoun, and 私 {わたし}, which is also formal, may be used by both genders.

/// 私 {わたし} is very frequently used by female speakers in both formal and casual situations. In very casual circumstances, it may be pronounced あたし by female speakers rather than わたし.

/// 僕 {ぼく}, used exclusively by male speakers of all ages, is less formal and more conversational than 私 {わたし} when used by male speakers.

<br>

### (2) Second-person

#### Use of the personal name

/// is often used instead of a pronoun to refer to the addressee in Japanese.

<br>

ずんだもんさんは一年生ですか。//Are you a freshman, Zundamon-san?

<br>

#### Use of deletion

/// is also frequently used in addressing someone.

/// When speaking directly to the addressee, deletion is more common than using a pronoun or a personal name.

<br>

三年生ですか。//Are you in the third grade?

<br>

#### Use of second-person pronouns (e.g., あなた)

/// Most of the time, a speaker should avoid using あなた to address: an older person, a person who holds a professional position,

/// あなた may be used: between people in a similar social situation, by a person who has more authority in a society to address someone with less power

/// In most cases, it is more common to use the name of the addressee with the appropriate ending such as ~さん or ~先生 {せんせい}, or to use deletion, rather than using あなた.

<br>

### (3) Third-person

/// Use of the third-person personal pronouns 彼 {かれ} for “he” and 彼女 {かのじょ} for “she” is more frequent among younger speakers in informal situations.

<br>

#### Deleting elements in sentences

/// The speaker may delete an element, or more than one element, from sentences when he or she judges that the addressee will be able to identify the deleted element(s).

<br>

### (4) Demonstrative pronouns

/// A speaker will use a demonstrative pronoun to point (literally or figuratively) to a particular person or a thing.

<br>

#### For people

/// こちら -> a person close to the speaker: “this person here”

/// そちら -> a person close to the addressee: “that person near you”

/// あちら -> a person far from both the speaker and the addressee: “that person over there”

<br>

#### For things

/// これ -> thing(s) close to the speaker: “this thing”

/// それ -> thing(s) close to the addressee: “that thing”

/// あれ -> hing(s) far from both the speaker and the addressee: “that thing over there”

/// の “one(s)” is another pronoun to refer to things.

<br>

### (5) Plural pronouns

/// In personal pronouns, it is indicated by ~達 {たち} and ~ら. The use of ~達 is more formal than the use of ~ら. 

/// Though it is not obligatory, ~ら can also be used with demonstrative pronouns for things.

<br>

#### Plural markers with regular nouns

/// plural markers are used mainly for pronouns, but they can be used for some nouns (for animate things) as well: 学生達 {がくせいたち} or 学生ら {がくせいら} “students,” for example. In 友達 {ともだち} “friend,”

/// Some nouns may be repeated to indicate that they are plural, but for the most part, nouns do not indicate number. Whether a noun is singular or plural is inferred from the use of words that indicate quantity and/or the context.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Yes-No Question Sentences

/// A yes-no question sentence is formed by adding the sentence-final particle か to a statement sentence.

/// The word order of the statement sentence remains unchanged.

/// Yes-no question sentences should be spoken with rising intonation.

<br>



今日は寒いですか。//Is it cold today?

ナースロボさんは日本語が分かりますか。//Do you understand Japanese, Naasurobo-san?

<br>

### (2) Positive responses

#### Responding positively by repeating the predicate

/// One way to respond positively to a question is simply to repeat the predicate following the positive acknowledgement, はい or ええ, both of which mean “yes.” 

/// はい is more formal than ええ, but ええ is more commonly used in conversation. 

/// The topic is often deleted in responses.

<br>

ずんだもんさんは一年生ですか。//Are you a freshman, Zundamon-san?

はい、（私は）一年生です。//Yes, I am a freshman.

今日は寒いですか。//Is it cold today?

ええ、（今日は）寒いです。//Yes, it’s cold today.

<br>

ナースロボさんは分かりますか。//Do you understand, Naasurobo-san?

ええ、（僕は）分かります。//Yes, I understand.

<br>

#### The generic positive response そうです

/// may be used as the generic positive response for the nominal predicate.

/// そう, which literally means “that way,” should be used alone without a topic. 

/// そうです can be used only when responding to questions with nominal predicates, unless ねえ rather than か is used at the end of the predicate.

<br>

（あなたは）ずんだもんさんですか。//Are you Zundamon-san?

ええ、そうです。//Yes, that’s right.

<br>

### (3) Negative responses

#### The generic negative response 違います  {ちがいます}

/// is a verb that means “to differ from something.”

/// It can be used as a generic negative response to a question using the nominal predicate.

/// should be used without a topic. It should only be used to respond a question with a nominal predicate.

<br>

いいえ、違います。//No, I am not.

<br>

#### Giving the correct information

<br>

いいえ、違います。（私は）時雨です。//No, I’m not. I’m Shigure.

いいえ。（私は）時雨です。//No. I’m Shigure.

<br>

#### Negative responses

/// may be given by negating predicates.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Negating Predicates

### (1) Negating the nominal predicate

/// ->  [です → では (or じゃ) ありません]

/// Using the contracted じゃ is more conversational than では.

今日は寒くありません。//It’s not cold today.

<br>

/// original form of the adjective いい “good” is よい

/// いいです→よくありません

<br>

これはいいです。//This is good.

それはよくありません。//That is not good.

<br>

/// A nominal predicate with an adjective

/// A predicate containing an adjective that modifies a noun within that predicate is a nominal predicate, not an adjectival predicate. 

/// The negation is that of a nominal predicate rather than an adjectival predicate.

<br>

ずんだもんさんはいい学生ですか。//Is Zundamon-san a good student?

いいえ、（ずんだもんさんは）いい学生じゃありません。//No, she is not a good student.

# Stage 1-2 Question Sentences

<br>

## 1: Alternative Questions

### (1) The three types of question sentences

/// Elements like the topic, if it is the same in both clauses, need not be repeated in the second question.

<br>

あなたは雪ノ下さんですか、（あなたは）時雨さんですか。//Are you Yukinoshita-san or Shigure-san?

<br>

#### Clausal and sentential conjunction それとも

/// the use of the conjunction それとも in alternative questions is optional.

/// Using それとも makes the question sound more formal, so in a casual conversation, this conjunction is often omitted.

<br>

<br>

#### Noun phrasal conjunction か

<br>

家に帰りますか、勉強しますか。//Will you go home or study?

どちらもしません。//I will do neither.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Information-Seeking Question Sentences - need to use interrogative pronouns

/// Information-seeking question sentences are interrogative sentences that seek specific responses rather than simply “yes” or “no.” 

/// As is the case with yes-no questions, the word order is the same as in a declarative sentence.

<br>

### (1) だれ(誰), [どなた (何方)] “who?”

/// In order to ask for the name of a person

<br>

/// なん should be used when asking about a number with a counter or a part of a series

/// なに should be used to ask what things. However, when なに is followed by a word that begins with /t/, /d/, /r/ or /n/, then なん should be used. An exception to this is that before the particle に, either なん or なに can be used.

<br>

それは何ですか。//What is that?

（これは）本です。//This is a book.

<br>

### (3) どこ (何処) “where?”

## 3: Modifying Nouns

### (1) Modifying a noun with an adjective

/// when an adjective modifies a noun, no particle is used between the adjective and the noun it modifies.

<br>

今日はいい天気です。//The weather is good today.

<br>

### (2) Modifying a noun with another noun

/// the particle の must be placed between the two nouns

/// In this structure, the first noun always modifies (that is, explains, describes, or qualifies) the second noun.

/// Since the first noun modifies the second noun, reversing the order of the nouns changes the meaning of the sentence.

/// More than two nouns may be used to modify a noun. In all cases, the last noun is the main noun and all nouns preceding it modify it.

<br>

#### の and demonstrative pronouns

/// The particle の must be placed after these demonstrative pronouns if they are followed by a noun. -> この, その, and あの

<br>

これは本です。//This is a book.

この本は雪ノ下さんの本です。//This book is Yukinoshita-san’s book.

<br>

/// These demonstrative pronouns are also used for personal pronouns, この人, その人, あの人

/// These personal pronouns are less formal than こちら, そちら, and あちら. 

/// Furthermore, こちら, そちら, and あちら are used when the person the speaker refers to is physically present at the time of speech; この人 {このひと}, その人 {そのひと}, and あの人 {あのひと} do not have the same requirement.

<br>

/// The noun after の can be deleted if it is understood, especially when it is inanimate.

<br>

これは私の本です。それはあなたのです。//This is my book. That is yours.

それは私のではありません。//That is not mine.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Adjectival Nouns

### (1) Two types of adjectives: adjectives and adjectival nouns

/// adjectival nouns is a noun in terms of its form but an adjective in meaning.

/// The predicate with an adjectival noun is a nominal predicate. So, when a predicate with an adjectival noun is negated, the negative form of the copula is used

<br>

元気ですか。元気です。//How are you? I am fine.

元気ではありません。//I am not well.

元気じゃありません。//I am not well.

<br>

#### Descriptive particle な

/// the function of adjectives is to describe nouns; they can be used immediately before the nouns that they modify

/// When an adjectival noun modifies a noun, the particle な must be placed between the two words

<br>

今日はいい天気です。//It’s really nice weather today.

今日はいやな天気ですねえ。//It’s really bad weather today, isn’t it?

<br>

雪ノ下さんは元気な学生です。//Yukinoshita-san is an energetic student.

あの学生は元気です。//That student is full of energy.

<br>

#### Summary of how to modify nouns

/// an adjective modifies a noun, use nothing between them;

/// an adjectival noun modifies a noun, use な between them;

/// a noun modifies another noun, use の between them;

/// a verb modifies a noun, the verb must be in the plain form, and the noun follows immediately, with no particle between them.

<br>

### (2) Interrogative pronouns どれ (何れ), どの (何の) and どんな

#### Interrogative pronoun どんな

/// どんな is an interrogative pronoun related to the pronouns こんな, そんな, and あんな, meaning “this kind of,” “that kind of,” and “that kind of.” 

/// どんな therefore means “what kind of.”

/// They must be followed by nouns. な in this set is the same な that joins adjectival nouns and nouns.

<br>

こんな本は高いですか。はい、とても高いです。//Is this kind of book expensive? Yes, it is very expensive.

あの本はどんな本ですか。//What kind of book is that book over there?

<br>

#### Differences between どれ, どちら, and どの

/// どれ “which one” is the interrogative pronoun related to the pronouns これ, それ, and あれ

/// どの “which (noun)” is the interrogative pronoun related to the pronouns この, その, and あの.

/// a noun must follow どの, while どれ is used in isolation. 

/// In both cases, the question focuses on isolating one of many options.

<br>

あなたのかばんはどれですか。//Which one is your backpack?

あなたのかばんはどのかばんですか。//Which backpack is your backpack?

<br>

/// If there are only two options (rather than many), どちら should be used rather than どれ.

<br>

あなたのかばんはどちらですか。//Which one (of two) is your backpack?

あなたのかばんはどちらのかばんですか。//Which backpack  (of two)  is your backpack?

<br>

#### The difference between どんな and どの

/// Both どんな and どの must be followed by a noun. 

/// However, どんな asks for a description, whereas どの only asks for an identification.

<br>

アリスさんはどんな人ですか。//What kind of person is Alice-san?

（アリスさんは）元気な人です。//Alice-san is a cheerful person.

<br>

/// どの asks the listener to identify a specific thing or person out of the available options.

<br>

アリスさんは どの人ですか。//Which person is Alice-san?

（アリスさんは）あの人です。//Alice-san is that person over there.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Conjunctions

### (1) Clausal conjunction が

/// The conjunction が joins clauses, rather than sentences.

/// The conjunction が must be accompanied by a phrase divider, rather than a period.

<br>

/// Contrast: when the speaker wishes to contrast an element in each of the two clauses:

<br>

私は日本人ですが、ナースロボさんはアメリカ人です。//I am Japanese, but Naasurobo-san is American.

<br>

/// Contradiction: when the second clause makes a statement that disagrees in sense with what can be inferred from the first clause:

<br>

私は雪ノ下ですが、（私は）日本人じゃありません。//I am Yukinoshita, but I am not Japanese.

<br>

### (2) Sentential and clausal conjunction けれども

/// けれども, is very similar to が.

<br>

私は日本人ですけれども、ナースロボさんはアメリカ人です。//I am Japanese, but Naasurobo-san is American.

私は雪ノ下ですけれども、（私は）日本人じゃありません。//I am Yukinoshita, but I am not Japanese.

<br>

/// けれども can also function like でも, because it can join two separate sentences.

<br>

私は日本人です。けれども、ナースロボさんはアメリカ人です。//I am Japanese, but Naasurobo-san is American.

私は雪ノ下です。けれども、（私は）日本人じゃありません。//I am Yukinoshita, but I am not Japanese.

<br>

/// More casual forms of けれども delete certain syllables: they are けれど, けど, and (less frequently) け ども.

/// The fewer the number of syllables this conjunction has, the less formal it sounds.

<br>

#### Summary of でも, が, and けれども

/// でも：must be used between two separate sentences

/// が：must be used between two separate clauses

/// けれども：may be used between two separate sentences or between two clauses

<br>

/// が is more formal than けれども. 

/// けれども is more formal than でも, especially when all four syllables are used. 

/// When the number of syllables of けれども is reduced, as in けど, it is less formal than でも.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 6: Adverbs with Negative Predicates

/// Adverbs give a sense of the degree of the description or the degree of the negation that the speaker wishes to convey to the addressee in the predicate.

<br>

/// In Japanese, a speaker must in some cases use different adverbs for positive and negative sentences.

/// Some adverbs are therefore used only with negative predicates.

/// adverbs can soften or strengthen the negation.

<br>

#### あまり

/// とても is used with a positive response while あまり is used with a negative one.

<br>

あの先生はいい先生ですか。//Is that teacher a good teacher?

とてもいい先生です。//She is a very good teacher.

あまりいい先生ではありません。//She is not a very good teacher.

あまりいい先生じゃありません。//She is not a very good teacher.

<br>

/// There are cases in which あまり is used with positive predicates, but the meaning is quite Different

<br>

#### そんなに 

/// is used with a negative predicate, corrects the degree to which a description is assumed or presented to be true.

<br>

雪ノ下さんは本当にいい学生ですねえ。//Yukinoshita-san is really a good student, isn’t she?

雪ノ下さんはそんなにいい学生じゃありません。//Yukinoshita-san is not that good.

<br>

/// そんなに therefore refers back to some previously mentioned, or simply assumed, evaluation.

/// This assumption may be made by the addressee as well as by the speaker. あまり does not imply such reference.

<br>

#### 全然  {ぜんぜん}

/// negates the description in the predicate completely.

<br>

日本は寒いですか。//Is it cold in Japan?

全然、寒くありません。//It is not cold at all.

<br>

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Backchanneling

<br>

あなた達は二年生ですか、三年生ですか。//Are you sophomores or a third grader?

二年生でも三年生でもありません。一年生ですよ。//Neither. Actually, we’re freshmen.

一年生ですか。//You’re freshmen, are you?

<br>

/// The function of this kind of repeated sentence is to give the addressee an acknowledgement that one is listening; 

/// very similar expressions to “oh?” “I see,” or “uh-huh” in English

<br>

### (2) Location or name?

<br>

花澤さんの大学はどこですか。//Which university do you go to?

京都の大学です。//I go to a university in Kyoto.

<br>

### (3) Changing the topic or making a conclusion

<br>

それは何ですか。//What is that?

かばんです。でも、僕のじゃありません。//It’s a backpack. But it’s not mine.

じゃ、これは？//How about this one, then?

ああ、それは僕のです。//Oh, that one’s mine.

<br>

/// To change the topic or make a conclusive statement, a speaker may use じゃ ( or では in a more formal situation).

<br>

### (4) Repeating the question before answering

<br>

雪ノ下さんの専攻は何ですか。//What is your major, Naasurobo-san?

専攻ですか。日本語です。//My major? It’s Japanese.

<br>

/// Japanese people tend to repeat a word, a phrase, or sometimes even an entire sentence from the question that was asked before giving a response.

/// This is not rude; it is just a way to confirm that the speaker is responding to the right question. 

/// It also provides an extra moment to think about the response to the question.stage １，３。

# Stage 1-3 Aspects of Predicates

## 1: Four Aspects

/// In Japanese, the forms of the predicate indicate aspect rather than tense.

/// Rather than referring to the time of an action or event, aspect refers to such things as whether an action or event is completed, continuous, etc.

<br>

/// Time in Japanese is expressed and interpreted by way of the use of an aspectual form of the predicate together with other elements such as a time adverb and/or context.

<br>

/// In Japanese, all predicates have two aspectual forms: imperfective and perfective.

/// Both imperfective and perfective forms of predicates have positive and negative forms as well.

<br>

/// The imperfective form is used to express 

/// 1. an action that is not completed (for action verbs), or 

/// 2. the current state (for non-action predicates).

<br>

/// The perfective form is used for

/// 1. an action that is or has been completed (for action verbs), or

/// 2. the past state (for non-action predicates).

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Positive and negative imperfectives

#### Action verbs

/// The imperfective form of an action verb indicates that the action has not been completed. 

/// Therefore, this form can be used for future action, as in the sentence “I will read a book tonight.”

/// It is also used to express habitual action with no specific time reference as in “I usually read a book before I go to bed.”

/// The difference between future and habitual actions is indicated by the use of certain time adverbs or by the context.

<br>

私は明日、本を読みます。//I will read a book tomorrow.

私は毎日、本を読みます。//I read books every day.

<br>

/// The imperfective positive form does not indicate ongoing action that is currently taking place: “I’m reading a book now.”

<br>

/// the use of negative imperfective forms also indicates negation of either habitual or future actions.

/// the key to distinguishing the habitual from the future sense is the use of time adverbs or context.

<br>

私は明日、本を読みません。//I will not read a book tomorrow.

私は毎日、本を読みません。//I don’t read books every day.

<br>

#### Non-action predicates

/// Nominal, adjectival, and some verbal predicates do not refer to actions.

/// For these predicates, the imperfective forms indicate the current state rather than future or habitual.

<br>

僕は一年生です。//I am a freshman.

僕は一年生じゃありません。//I am not a freshman.

<br>

今日は寒いです。//It is cold today.

今日は寒くありません。//It is not cold today.

<br>

ナースロボさんは日本語が話せます。//Naasurobo-san can speak Japanese.

ナースロボさんは日本語が話せません。//Naasurobo-san cannot speak Japanese.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Aspects of nominal predicates

#### Positive perfective forms

/// -> [です → でした]

/// Aspects of the nominal predicate are expressed by the forms of the copula.

<br>

私は学生です。//I’m a student.

私は学生でした。//I was a student.

<br>

#### Negative perfective forms

/// -> [(the negative imperfective predicate) + でした]

/// Change the predicate to the negative imperfective form first, and then add でした.

<br>

私は一年生ではありませんでした。//I wasn’t a freshman.

私は一年生じゃありませんでした。//I wasn’t a freshman.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Aspects of adjectival predicates

#### Positive perfective forms

/// -> [~い → ~かった + です]

/// です functions as the marker for the polite form.

<br>

大きいです。大きかったです。//is big. was big.

いいです。よかったです。//is good. was good.

<br>

#### Negative perfective forms

/// -> [(the negative imperfective predicate) + でした]

/// Change the predicate to the negative imperfective form first, and then add でした.

<br>



昨日は寒くありませんでした。//It wasn’t cold yesterday.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (5) Aspects of verbal predicates

#### Positive perfective forms

/// -> [~ます → ~ました]

<br>

昨日、私は日本語を勉強しました。//I studied Japanese yesterday.

<br>

日本語が話せました。//I used to be able to speak Japanese.

<br>

#### Negative perfective forms

/// -> [(the negative imperfective predicate) + でした]

/// Change the predicate into the negative imperfective form first, and then add でした.

<br>

昨日、勉強しませんでした。//I didn’t study yesterday.

<br>

日本語が話せませんでした。//I wasn’t able to speak Japanese.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Other Aspects

### (1) Continuous aspect

/// The continuous aspect of action verbs is constructed by combining what is called the conjunctive form of a verb and another verb, います.

/// In meaning, this construction conveys any continuous aspect of action verbs.

<br>

僕は本を読みます。//I will read a book. I normally read a book.

<br>

僕は本を読んでいます。//I am reading a book (now). I have been reading a book.

僕は本を読んでいません。//I’m not reading a book now. I have not been reading a book.

僕は本を読んでいました。//I was reading a book then. I had been reading a book.

僕は本を読んでいませんでした。//I wasn’t reading a book then. I had not been reading a book.

<br>

#### Conjunctive forms of predicates

/// While the rules for deriving the conjunctive forms from the base forms of the nominal and adjectival predicates are simple, the rules for deriving the conjunctive forms of verbs are quite complex.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Volitional aspect

#### The volitional forms of verbs

/// -> [~ます → ~ましょう]

/// is used when the speaker wants to suggest some action to the addressee(s) that would include the speaker himself or herself, as in “Let’s do such-and-such.”

<br>

行きます。//will go

行きましょう。//Let’s go.

行きましょうか。//Shall we go?

<br>

/// Certain verbs, such as non-action verbs, cannot be used to mean “let’s do such-and-such,” but every verb has a volitional form because the volitional forms are used in other constructions for different meanings.

<br>

#### The volitional form of the copula -> [です→ でしょう]

/// may be used with all predicate types: nominal, adjectival, and verbal predicates.

/// The copula です is used when the speaker is certain about the content of a sentence.

/// When the speaker is not absolutely certain, but fairly sure, about the content expressed in the predicate, then the volitional でしょう is used.

/// The adverb 多分 {たぶん} “perhaps, probably” is often used in a sentence with でしょう, although it is not an obligatory element.

<br>

あの人は学生でしょう。//That person is probably a student.

<br>

多分このかばんは高いでしょう。//This backpack is probably expensive.

<br>

/// For verbal predicates, the plain form of the verb must be used before でしょう

<br>

ナースロボさんは日本語が分かるでしょう。//Naasurobo-san probably understands Japanese.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) A summary of aspectual forms

<br>

#### Nominal predicates

<br>

一年生です。//I’m a freshman.

一年生ではありません。//I’m not a freshman.

一年生でした。//I was a freshman.

一年生ではありませんでした。//I wasn’t a freshman.

一年生でしょう。//[Someone else] is probably a freshman.

<br>

#### Adjectival predicates

<br>

今日は寒いです。//It is cold today.

今日は寒くありません。//It is not cold today.

今日は寒かったです。//It was cold today.

今日は寒くありませんでした。//It was not cold today.

今日は寒いでしょう。//It is probably cold today.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates (non-action verbs)

<br>

日本語が話せます。//I can speak Japanese.

日本語が話せません。//I can’t speak Japanese.

日本語が話せました。//I could speak Japanese.

日本語が話せませんでした。//I couldn’t speak Japanese.

日本語が話せるでしょう。//[Someone] can probably speak Japanese.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates (action verbs)

日本語を勉強していません。//I’m not studying Japanese.

日本語を勉強していました。//I was studying Japanese.

日本語を勉強していませんでした。//I wasn’t studying Japanese.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Conjunctions

### (1) Sentential conjunctions その前に, その後で, and その時に

/// When nouns such as 前 {まえ} “before,” 後 {あと} “after,” and 時 {とき} “time,” are used with the demonstrative その, they function as sentential conjunctions (i.e., conjunctions that connect two sentences).

<br>

私は去年、日本に行きました。その前（に）、日本語を勉強しました。//I went to Japan last year. Before that, I studied Japanese.

映画を見ました。その後（で）、ハンバーグを食べました。//I watched a movie. After that, I ate a hamburger.

去年、日本に行きました。その時（に）、日本語を勉強しました。//I went to Japan last year. At that time, I studied Japanese.

<br>

#### Noun with 前, 後, and 時

<br>

朝ご飯の前（に）、勉強しました。//Before breakfast, I studied.

朝ご飯の後（で）、勉強しました。//After breakfast, I studied.

朝ご飯の時（に）、勉強しました。//During breakfast, I studied.

<br>

### (2) Sentential conjunction だから

/// is used at the beginning of a second sentence to indicate a consequence that follows from the first sentence.

/// The first sentence shows the reason for the consequence expressed in the second sentence.

<br>

私は日本語が分かりませんでした。だから、英語を話しました。//I didn’t understand Japanese, so I spoke English.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Joining Predicates with Conjunctive Forms

### (1) Limitations ofと

/// the conjunction と joins only nouns and noun phrases, but may not be used to join predicates or sentences.

/// The reason と is acceptable in the following sentence is that the two nouns are joined in one predicate.

<br>

先生はずんだもん先生と時雨先生です。//The teachers are Zundamon-sensei and Shigure-sensei.

<br>

### (2) First predicate as nominal predicate

/// The conjunctive form of the copula is で.

/// Use で to join a nominal predicate to another predicate

/// also with a nominal predicate that consists of an adjectival noun and the copula.

<br>

僕はナースロボで、日本語の学生です。//I’m Naasurobo, and I’m a student of Japanese.

エイミーさんは元気で、きれいです。//Amy-san is cheerful and pretty.

<br>

### (3) First predicate as adjectival predicate

/// The conjunctive form of an adjective is obtained by changing the final ~い to ~くて

<br>

中国は大きくて、遠いです。//China is large. It’s also far away.

日本語の授業はよくて、楽しいです。//My Japanese class is good as well as fun.

<br>

### (4) First predicate as verbal predicate

#### Action verbs

/// The conjunctive form of the verb します is して.

<br>

私は勉強して、運動します。//I will study and then exercise.

<br>

/// When two action verbs are joined by the conjunctive form, the order of the actions is expressed by the order of their presentation.

/// That is, in interpreting the sentence, the listener understands that the action expressed first will be completed before the action expressed second.

<br>

私は勉強して、運動しました。//I studied and then exercised.

<br>

#### Non-action verbs

/// In sentences with non-action verbs, the meaning is not affected by the order of the predicates.

<br>

あの人は英語も話せて、漢字も読めます。//That person can speak English as well as read kanji.

<br>

/// Since the sentence order does not assume an order of events, it is possible to reverse the order of the above sentence without changing the meaning:

<br>

あの人は漢字も読めて、英語も話せます。//That person can read kanji as well as speak English.

<br>

#### When the topics are different

/// When the topics of the two predicates to be joined are different, the order of the predicates does not imply the order of the actions, even if action verbs are used.

<br>

昨日、僕は勉強して、時雨さんは運動しました。//I studied yesterday, but Shigure-san exercised.

<br>

/// In a real situation, any number of predicates may be joined.

/// In this case, all except the final predicate are joined by using the conjunctive form.

<br>

寮の部屋はきれいで、小さいです。//The dorm room is clean and small.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Particles

### (1) Thematic について

/// indicating that the preceding noun is the theme of speaking, reading, writing, and so forth.

<br>

私は明日、日本について話します。//I will talk about Japan tomorrow.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Accompaniment と

/// と used as a particle indicates accompaniment.

<br>

私はナースロボさんと映画に行きます。//I will go to a movie with Naasurobo-san.

昨日、（僕は）ずんだもん先生と話しました。//I talked with Zundamon-sensei yesterday.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Instrumental で

/// The particle で gives the instrumental function to the preceding noun,

/// which means that the noun preceding the particle refers to the means by which the event described in the verb is accomplished or carried out.

<br>

日本人は箸で食べます。//Japanese people eat with chopsticks.

（僕は）学校にいつもバスで行きます。//I always go to school by bus.

<br>

/// When the means refers to an action, as in “by walking,” the conjunctive form of a verb is used.

<br>

私は学校にいつも歩いて行きます。//I always go to school on foot.

<br>

#### The place particle で marking the place of action

/// で is used with a place noun to indicate that the action of the verb in the sentence occurs in that place.

/// で here is also instrumental, expressing the use of a place for the action.

<br>

チャンさんは新聞を図書館で読みます。//Chang-san will read the newspaper at the library.

<br>

/// Compare this with the directional particle に:

<br>

チャンさんは図書館に行きます。//Chang-san will go to the library.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 6: Topic and Contrastive は

### (1) Topicalizing an element

/// In Japanese, the speaker can make any element the topic of a sentence by bringing it to the sentence-initial position and marking it with は.

<br>

来年もナースロボさんは日本語を勉強しますか。//Naasurobo-san, will you study Japanese next year as well?

中国語は勉強しませんが、日本語を勉強します。//[As for Chinese,] I will not study it, but I will study Japanese.

<br>

### (2) Contrastive は

/// は also has another function: that is, the contrastive function.

/// The topic can be inherently contrastive.

/// Since the speaker has chosen one element as the focus of his or her comments, that topic is implicitly or explicitly contrasted with some other elements.

<br>

これは私の本ですが、あれはエミリーさんのです。//This book is mine, but that one is EmiLy-san’s.

私は、本は読みますが、新聞は読みません。//I will read a book, but not a newspaper.

<br>

/// when two or more noun phrases are marked by は in a sentence, the first noun (or noun phrase) marked by は is usually the topic of the sentence; any subsequent ones are contrastive elements.

<br>

/// With the exception of particles that are conjunctive in nature such as の, and overriding particles,

/// the same particle may not be used for the same function more than once in a clause or a sentence.

/// Because it is common for a single particle to have multiple functions, as long as the function of the particle is different each time it is used, the same particle may be used multiple times in a sentence.

<br>

/// は, used contrastively and for topicalization, is an overriding particle. Generally speaking, overriding particles replace the particles が and を, and are used together with other particles.

/// In the following example, the particle に is used with the contrastive は:

<br>

今日は、日本語の授業には行きません。//I will not go to Japanese class today.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Confirming with ね

<br>

アリスさんは二年生ですね。//Alice-san, you’re a sophomore, right?

ええ、そうです。//Yes, I am.

<br>

/// The use of ね with a short vowel indicates that the speaker is confirming his or her understanding of a situation with the addressee.

<br>

### (2) Indirectness in conversation

<br>

アリスさんは二年生ですね。//Alice-san, you’re a sophomore, right?

いえ、僕は三年生ですが・・・。//No, I’m a third grader, but . . . [why do you ask?]

<br>

#### Incomplete sentences in conversation

/// The conjunction が at the end of the second sentence in the example above indicates that the sentence is not quite finished, but the speaker has decided not to continue.

/// This kind of unfinished sentence marked by が happens quite often in conversation in Japanese. Though it sounds very vague, sometimes not finishing a sentence is more polite than saying everything.

<br>

### (3) Confirming with か

<br>

日本語は難しくありませんか。//Isn’t Japanese hard for you?

難しいです。//You’re right. It is difficult.

<br>

日本語は難しくありませんか。//Isn’t Japanese hard for you?

いいえ。易しいです。//I don’t think so. It’s easy.

<br>

#### Negative questions with か

/// A question is often asked with a negative predicate when the speaker is fairly certain about something but not 100 percent certain.

<br>

この本は高くありませんか。//This book is expensive, isn’t it?

<br>

/// the addressee uses ええ to agree with the assumption

<br>

ええ。高いです。//You’re right. It is expensive.

<br>

/// いいえ is used to show that the addressee’s assumption is somewhat different from the reality.

/// So, the actual fact is added after indicating that the addressee’s assumption is incorrect by the use of いいえ.

<br>

いいえ。高くありません。//You are incorrect. It is not expensive.

<br>

### (4) Confirming with ねえ

<br>

日本語は易しくありませんねえ。//Japanese isn’t easy, don’t you think so?

ええ、本当に易しくありませんねえ。//You’re right, it’s not easy.

<br>

#### Negative questions with ねえ

/// When the speaker is trying to convey his or her impression with a negative predicate and wants to confirm that impression with the addressee, the sentence-final particle ねえ is often used in a question

<br>

この本は高くありませんねえ。//This book is not expensive, don’t you agree?

ええ、そんなに高くありませんねえ。//You are right. It is not that expensive.

そうですか。高いです。//Really? It is expensive.

<br>

### (5) Avoiding bluntness

<br>

日本語は易しくありませんねえ。//Japanese isn’t easy, don’t you think so?

そうですか。あんまり難しくありませんが・・・。//Really? It’s not that difficult, but . . .

<br>

#### そうですか

/// At times, giving a negative response with いいえ or いえ may be too blunt. In this case, it is possible to acknowledge the question by saying そうですか, which softens the bluntness of the response.

<br>

/// あんまり is a spoken form of あまり.stage １，４。

# Stage 1-4 Numbers and Counters

<br>

## 1: Numbers

### (1) Native Japanese and Sino-Japanese numbers

/// For the numbers 1 through 10, there are two systems of counting.

/// One is the native Japanese number system; the other, the Sino-Japanese number system, is borrowed from the Chinese.

/// 一、二、三、四、五、六、七、八、九、十。//1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

<br>

#### From 1,000 to 9,000 

/// 千 (せん)

/// the “1” in 1,000 is normally neither pronounced nor written.

<br>

#### From 10,000 to 90,000

/// 万 (まん)

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Counters

### (1) What are counters?

/// In Japanese, counters are expressed by suffixes used immediately following the numbers.

/// Counters are thus not independent words and cannot be used in isolation.

/// Logically, all numbers must be used with appropriate counters depending on what is being counted.

<br>

### (2) Time

#### 時 {じ} for the specific hour

<br>

三時十五分すぎです。//It’s 15 minutes past 3:00.

<br>

/// The term to indicate the half hour is 半 {はん}.

/// When using 半 {はん} “half,” the word すぎ “past” or the counter 分 {ふん} may not be added.

<br>

<br>

/// When the time is close to the next hour, 前 {まえ}, which means “before,” can be used

<br>

/// It is therefore used for such things as ranking.

/// This counter is also used to indicate telephone numbers.

<br>

## 3: Using Numbers in Sentences

/// Numbers can function adjectivally or adverbially.

<br>

### (1) Adverbial use

/// When it is used adverbially, the number should be used before the verb and without any particle.

/// this counter can be used in any position except at the end of the sentence

<br>

私はペンを二本、買いました。//I bought two pens.

私は二本、ペンを買いました。//I bought two pens.

<br>

### (2) Adjectival use

/// A number can also modify a noun.

/// When a number is used adjectivally, it must be placed immediately before the noun it modifies. The particle の must be placed between them.

<br>

/// When a number modifies a noun, the meaning of the phrase is quite different from the structure in which a number is used adverbially.

/// The speaker is referring only to a specific things. In this case, the noun modified by the number can be deleted.

<br>

一本（のペン）はルームメートのです。//One (of the pens) is my roommate’s

<br>

### (3) Joining more than one number in a sentence

/// One way is to make two separate sentences joined by a sentential conjunction.

<br>

ペンを五本、買いました。そして、本を三冊、買いました。//I bought five pens. Also, I bought three books.

<br>

/// When the predicate is the same, another way is to join the noun phrases (the numbers and the nouns) with the conjunction と

<br>

ペンを五本と本を三冊、買いました。//I bought five pens and three books.

<br>

### (4) The use of ずつ

/// When the number and the counter are the same for two different objects (e.g., three pens and three pencils), there is no need to repeat the number twice.

/// Instead, the word ずつ, which means “each,” should be used after the counter.

<br>

ペンと鉛筆を三本ずつ買いました。。//I bought three pens and three pencils.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Getting someone’s attention

<br>

あのう、すみません、今、何時ですか。//Uh . . . excuse me, but what time is it now?

さあ、何時でしょうか。//Let’s see . . . I wonder what time it might be?

<br>

/// あのう is an utterance used when the speaker wants to hesitate a bit before speaking. This may also be a way to gain the attention of the addressee before starting to speak.

<br>

/// さあ indicates that the speaker is unsure of the response to the question asked.

<br>

### (2) Expressing surprise

<br>

これ、いくらでした。//How much was this?

ちょうど五万円でした。//It was exactly 50,000 yen.

へえ、随分、高いですねえ。//Are you serious? That’s a lot more than I thought.

<br>

#### A question without か

/// When speaking colloquially, the sentence-final particle か may be omitted. In this case, the sentence must be uttered with a rising intonation.

<br>

/// The utterance へえ indicates that the speaker did not expect the answer that was given. へえ thus expresses surprise. This must be said with a rising intonation.

<br>

### (3) At a store

# Stage 1-5 On Verbs

## 1: Verbs of Existence

### (1) Expressing existence in English and Japanese

/// The verb “to be” (am, are, is) in English is used to indicate two different meanings: that of identification and that of existence.

<br>

/// In Japanese, identification and existence must be expressed by separate predicates:

/// the copula だ （です） is used for identification, and the verbs いる（います） and ある（あります） are used for existence.

<br>

/// Which verb to use when expressing existence depends on the topic.

/// When the topic is animate (people, animals, etc.), the verb いる（います） should be used;

/// when the topic is inanimate, the verb ある（あります） should be used.

<br>

学生は家にいます。//The student is at home.

本は家にあります。//The book is at home.

<br>

#### Animate vs. inanimate

/// いる (居る): living things that can move on their own (such as people and animals) are considered animate; 

/// ある (有る, 在る): anything, living or not, that cannot move on its own (such as plants and household objects) is considered inanimate.

/// The existence of animals that do not move, such as clams, is expressed with ある（あります） as well.

<br>

#### Place pronouns

/// ここ。here; そこ。there;あそこ。over there; どこ。an inquiry regarding place.

<br>

#### Location particle に

/// The location of existence is marked by the particle に

<br>

学生はここにいます。//The student is here.

本はあそこにあります。//The book is over there.

<br>

/// The particle で with the verb ある（あります）

/// When the sentence implies some action, the particle で must be used along with the place noun, even with the verb ある（あります）

<br>

試験はあそこにあります。//The exam paper is over there.

試験はあそこであります。//The exam will be held over there.

<br>

パーティーはあの部屋であります。//The party will be held in that room.

<br>

#### Specific locations

/// Specific locations are expressed with nouns such as 前 {まえ} “front” and 後ろ {うしろ} “back.”

/// These specific locations are usually modified by a reference point.

/// The particle の is used between the two nouns, with the modifying noun followed by the modified noun.

<br>

私の鞄は椅子の前にあります。//My backpack is in front of the chair.

私の鞄は椅子の後ろにあります。//My backpack is behind of the chair.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Word order and particles

#### Definite vs. indefinite nouns

/// In English, definite nouns (those that refer to a specific item) and indefinite nouns (those that refer to a non-specific item) can be identified by the use of the definite article “the” and the indefinite articles “a” and “an”:

<br>

/// Japanese does not have articles to indicate whether a noun is definite or indefinite.

/// Interpreting what is definite and indefinite is therefore related to what is known and new information.

<br>

#### Known vs. new information

/// In Japanese, newer information (from the addressee’s point of view) tends to be placed at a later point in the sentence.

<br>

鞄に本があります。//There is a book in my bag.

本は鞄にあります。//The book is in the bag.

<br>

/// the use of が indicates the topic is new information

<br>

鞄に何がありますか。//What’s in the bag?

（鞄に）本があります。//There is a book in the bag.

<br>

本はどこにありますか。//Where is the book?

（本は）鞄にあります。//The book is in the bag.

<br>

/// Indicating whether nouns are definite or indefinite in other grammatical structures may be accomplished by other means, such as the use of demonstrative pronouns （e.g., その本） or the context in which the nouns are used.

<br>

#### Noun phrasal conjunction や

/// と is used to join two or more nouns or noun phrases.

/// The conjunction や functions in the same way; however, the implication when や is used is different than when と is used.

/// When two or more nouns are joined by や, the implication is that more things are involved than those mentioned in the sentence.

<br>

ここにコーヒーとお茶があります。//There is coffee and tea here.

ここにコーヒーやお茶があります。//There is coffee and tea here (and other things as well).

<br>

#### だ（です）as the abbreviated predicate

/// The three functions of the copula include 

/// 1. equating the topic and the predicate; 

/// 2. providing the conjugations for the nominal predicate; 

/// 3. marking the speech style for the nominal and adjectival predicates.

<br>

/// In addition to these three functions, the copula can also be used as a substitute for the understood predicate.

/// In conversation, one-word responses are quite common. The predicate may be deleted in these cases, but in place of the predicate, the copula can be used.

/// particle will normally not be used between the single word and だ（です）.

<br>

私の本はどこにありますか。//Where’s my book?

ここです。//It’s here.

<br>

昨日、どこに行きましたか。//Where did you go yesterday?

ニューヨークです。//New York.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) The honorific いらっしゃる（いらっしゃいます）

/// 敬語 {けいご} is the term for “honorifics” in Japanese.

<br>

/// Politeness, as it relates to the relationship between speaker and addressee, is expressed through the use of the verb ending ~ます in the verbal predicate, or です in the nominal and adjectival predicates.

<br>

/// The use of an honorific predicate reflects the respect felt by the speaker toward the person in the topic position in a sentence.

/// The honorific predicate is never used when a member of the speaker’s family or immediate circle is the topic.

<br>

母はアメリカにいます。//My mother is in America.

エイミー先生はアメリカにいらっしゃいます。//Amy-sensei is in America.

<br>

/// This honorific verb いらっしゃる（いらっしゃいます） is used as the verb for existence, as well as for the verbs “to come” and “to go.”

<br>

先生は大学にいらっしゃいました。//The teacher was at the college.

<br>

/// or “The teacher went to the college.”

/// or “The teacher came to the college.”

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Transitivity of Predicates

/// The three types of predicates transitivity, they are categorized as transitive, intransitive, and semi-transitive predicates.

<br>

### (1) Transitive

/// A transitive predicate requires a direct object in a sentence.

/// The use of a transitive predicate indicates that the topic is acting physically or mentally upon, or is moving, the direct object.

/// This kind of predicate therefore expresses actions.

<br>

/// the direct object of a transitive verb is marked by the particle を.

<br>

毎日、学生は本を読みます。//Students read books every day.

<br>

/// It is important to note that classification of transitivity between two languages such as Japanese and English does not correlate directly.

<br>

#### Two-object transitive predicates

/// Some transitive predicates require two objects for a concept to be complete

/// as in the English sentence “I wrote a letter to my mother.” 

/// In such a case, what the subject wrote—a letter—is the direct object, because the subject operates on it directly.

/// The person to whom the letter was addressed, “my mother,” is the indirect object; it receives the direct object and is thus affected indirectly by the action of the subject.

<br>

#### Indirect object particle に

/// the indirect object is marked by the particle に. This is similar to the directional particle に.

/// thus the indirect object is related to destination.

<br>

/// The order of the two objects may be changed without affecting the meaning of the sentence (except for the newness of information provided by the speaker) as long as the correct particles are used:

<br>

私は母にメールを書きました。//I wrote an e-mail message to my mother.

私はメールを母に書きました。//I wrote an e-mail message to my mother.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Intransitive

/// Unlike the topic of a transitive predicate, the topic of an intransitive predicate is itself what undergoes the action, carries out the movement, or experiences the emotions expressed by the predicate.

/// An intransitive predicate does not have a direct object, but may contain other elements, such as the destination of a movement.

<br>

エイミーさんは明日、日本に行きます。//Amy-san will go to Japan tomorrow.

エイミーさんは明日、日本へ行きます。//Amy-san will go to Japan tomorrow.

<br>

/// Although に and へ may be used interchangeably with directional verbs, に is preferred when the verb is 来る {くる}（きます） “to come.”

<br>

エイミーさんは昨日、ここに来ました。//Amy-san came here yesterday.

<br>

#### を with intransitive verbs

/// The particle を has been introduced as the direct object marker of transitive verbs.

/// This particle is also used with intransitive verbs that express movement from the topic’s original location to another place (either outside of the original place or within that space).

/// This function of を in this case is to mark where the topic “passes through the place.” Thus, the verbs associated with this particle are those that express directional movement, such as “to pass,” “to walk,” “to run,” “to go out,” “to drive,” etc.

<br>

私は町まで歩きました。//I walked to town.

私は町で歩きました。//I walked in town.

私は町を歩きました。//I walked through town.

<br>

/// The particle を is also used with verbs such as 卒業する {そつぎょうする}（します） “to graduate,” 出る {でる} （でます） “to leave” (a place), and 休む {やすむ}（やすみます） “to rest.” 

/// The nuance is that the topic goes out from a location after passing through the space enclosed by the location

<br>

昨日、家を出ました。//He left home yesterday.

去年、高校を卒業しました。//I graduated from high school last year.

<br>

明日、学校を休みます。//I will not come to school tomorrow.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Semi-transitive

/// The predicates categorized as semi-transitive share characteristics of both transitive and intransitive predicates.

/// They resemble transitive predicates because they require a direct object. Unlike transitive predicates, however, the topic of a semi-transitive predicate does not move or operate on the object.

/// Instead, it experiences or goes through a stative condition such as the possession of a thing, ability, or emotional need. In this way, semi-transitive predicates resemble intransitive predicates.

/// The direct object of a semi-transitive predicate must be marked by が rather than を.

<br>

/// Compare the following two sentences with different verbs: 

/// 話す {はなす}（はなします） “to speak” is a transitive verb, which indicates the action of speaking.

/// 話せる {はなせる}（はなせます） “to be able to speak” is a semi-transitive verb that indicates one’s ability to speak.

<br>

ナースロボさんはいつもずんだもんさんに日本語を話します。//Naasurobo-san always speaks Japanese to Zundamon-san.

ナースロボさんは日本語が話せます。//Smith-san can speak Japanese.

<br>

/// other kinds of predicates may have direct objects marked by が as well.

<br>

私はもっと時間が欲しいです。//I want more time.

僕は犬が怖いです。//I’m afraid of dogs.

<br>

私は寿司が好きです。//I like sushi.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Verbs of Giving and Receiving

### (1) うち vs. そと

/// うち (in-group): A group to which the speaker belongs: this group can be a family, a company, a club, etc. The in-group may change from situation to situation.

<br>

妹は姉にセーターを上げました。//My little sister gave my big sister a sweater.

<br>

小夜さんは先生に花を差し上げました。//Sayo-san gave her teacher some flowers.

<br>

#### 下さる {くださる}（くださいます）

/// As with くれる（くれます）, when the receiver is the speaker, the use of 私に or 僕に may be unnecessary.

<br>

エイミー先生は妹に花を下さいました。//Amy-sensei gave my younger sister some flowers.

<br>

/// As in the case of くれる（くれます）, when the topic gives something to someone who is not the speaker or a member of the speaker’s うち-group, this verb may not be used.

<br>

<br>

#### A summary of giving/receiving verbs

/// When the topic is the giver:

/// Giver -> [さしあげる, あげる, やる]

<br>

/// When the topic is the giver and the receiver is the speaker or うち-group:

/// Giver - [くださる, くれる] -> うち as Receiver

<br>

/// When the topic is the receiver:

/// Receiver <- [いただく, もらう]

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Particles

### (1) の with other particles

/// the particle の joins two nouns or noun phrases, in which the first noun modifies the second.

<br>

友達の手紙。//my friend’s letter.

<br>

/// The phrase above is ambiguous, however. 

/// It can refer to a letter that is written by the speaker’s friend, or a letter that came to his/her friend, or something else.

<br>

### (2) Overriding particles だけ and しか

/// That is, だけ may be used along with the original particles, but this usage is optional

<br>

私だけ（が）日本に行きました。//Only I went to Japan.

私はコーヒーだけ（を）飲みました。//I drank only coffee.

/// However, だけ is normally used with other particles such as に or で. The order of the two particles is flexible.

<br>

私は日本にだけ行きました。//I went only to Japan.

私は日本だけに行きました。//I went only to Japan.

<br>

#### しか

/// The overriding particles だけ and しか share a similar meaning, but when しか is used, the predicate must be in the negative form.

/// The sentence with しか emphasizes the negative aspect of the sentence, while だけ highlights the positive aspect.

<br>

私は朝、コーヒーだけ飲みます。//I drink only coffee in the morning.

<br>

/// Unlike だけ, しか must follow the original particle; it may not precede it.

<br>

/// （いつも）(always)       いつか sometime/anytime

/// どれも not one thing    どれか one of the things

/// どちらも neither one    どちらか one of the two

<br>

/// Except for いつも, which does not have a negative meaning, the above pronouns formed with も require the predicate to be in the negative form.

/// も replaces は, が, or を, but is used along with other particles.

<br>

<br>

/// the quotative particle と connects the verb and the content of the quote, thoughts, or sounds.

/// The use of this particle is optional when the onomatopoeia contains repeated syllables.

<br>

/// When reporting only the content rather than something verbatim, remove the quotation marks and use the plain form for the content.

<br>

#### Expressing thoughts

/// the speaker may express an opinion or idea by connect ing his or her own thought with と and the verb 思う {おもう}（おもいます） “to think.”

/// This verb is used to express the speaker’s own thought; it is not used when the topic is in the third person.

/// When questioning the addressee directly for his or her opinion, the second person may be used in the topic position.

<br>

私はこの寿司は美味しいと思います。//I think that this sushi is delicious.

<br>

### (2) Types of onomatopoeia

/// Besides the onomatopoeia that originate in imitation of actual sounds, there are also other types of onomatopoeia in Japanese: e.g., onomatopoeia of manner and description, which mimic the manner of some activity or the quality of something.

<br>

### (3) The use of hiragana and katakana for onomatopoeia

/// While it is common to use katakana for sound onomatopoeia, onomatopoeia of manner and description are often written in hiragana, like the word きちん “properly” (manner)

/// The rules governing the use of katakana and hiragana for sound, manner, and descriptive onomatopoeia are not rigid, however. Variations in the use of these two kana in expressing onomatopoeia in writing may be observed.

<br>

/// The quotative particle と is necessary when the onomatopoeic word has no repeated elements.

<br>

あの人はいつもきちんと話します。//He always speaks properly.

この服はぼろぼろです。//This outfit is very old.

<br>

あのボロボロの服は私のです。//That old outfit is mine.

あの人はいつもピカピカの車を運転します。//That person always drives a shiny car.

<br>

#### Descriptive onomatopoeia with する（します）

/// Descriptive verbs may be created by adding する（します） to onomatopoeia.

/// どきどきする “to be nervous” （どきどき is the sound of someone’s heart pounding）

/// わくわくする “to be excited” （わくわく describes the feeling of being excited）

/// おろおろする “to be confused, be lost” （おろおろ describes the feeling of being lost）

/// In any language, there are innumerable ways to express an event.

/// The two broad categories are person-focused expressions and situation-focused expressions.

/// In person-focused expressions, “who will do/does/did something” is explicitly stated.

/// In situation-focused expressions, by contrast, the event is expressed without explicitly indicating “who will do/does/did something.” 

/// For instance, if someone spills some milk, the person-focused expression would be “I spilled the milk” while the situation-focused expression might be “The milk spilled.”

<br>

/// Within the context of Japanese culture, in some cases it is preferable to use situation-focused expressions because they are more indirect than person-focused expressions.

<br>

/// する（します） for the person-focused and なる（なります） for the situation-focused.

<br>

### (2) The verb する（します）

#### する（します） for making a choice or decision

<br>

#### Asking “how old are you?”

/// To ask someone’s age, either 何才 {なんさい} or いくつ may be used, but いくつ is normally used for asking children their age.

## 1: Subject が

### (1) The subject and its use

/// The topic is described in the comment.

/// The subject is described in the predicate.

<br>

#### The subject particle が

/// a clausal conjunction;

/// the marker for the topic when it is being questioned;

/// the marker for the direct object of the semi-transitive predicate;

/// the marker for the subject.

<br>

### (2) Adverb position

/// When adverbs are used in structures like those above, the natural place to use them is before the comment, rather than immediately before the predicate.

/// This is because the comment, rather than the predicate alone, comprises a complete entity.

<br>

エイミーさんはとても頭がいいです。//Amy-san is very smart.

エイミーさんは頭がとてもいいです。//Amy-san is very smart.

<br>

/// When adverbs are used in structures like those above, the natural place to use them is before the comment, rather than immediately before the predicate.

ナースロボさんは目が大きいです。//Naasurobo-san has large eyes.

/// the predicate 大きい {おおきい} describes the subject, 目 {め} “eyes,” rather than the topic. 

<br>

ナースロボさんは自分の目が嫌いです。//Naasurobo-san doesn’t like her [own] eyes.

<br>

/// the predicate 嫌い {きらい} “to dislike” is semi-transitive. That is, what the topic dislikes is the object, 目 {め} “eyes.”

<br>

### (2) Direct objects of adjectives and adjectival nouns

/// Some adjectives and adjectival nouns are classified as semi-transitive predicates, because they require a direct object for the notion to be complete.

/// As is the case with all semi-transitive predicates, the objects of these adjectives and adjectival nouns are marked by が.

<br>

/// examples show cases where these words modify nouns:

/// 好きな本 上手な人 欲しい本 怖い先生

<br>

/// 好き {すき} “to be fond of” and 嫌い {きらい} “to dislike” can be modified by the adverbial prefix 大, which means “big” and is pronounced だい (on-reading).

/// This prefix may not be used for all other adjectives or adjectival nouns. Its use is quite limited.

<br>

私は寿司が大好きです。//I love sushi.

私は寿司が大嫌いです。//I can’t stand sushi.

<br>

/// Even though the words 嫌い and 下手 {へた} carry a negative meaning, they may not be used with the adverb あまり because the structures in which they are used are positive.

/// To convey the intended meaning above, use the following sentence:

<br>

私はこの本があまり好きではありません。//I don’t like this book very much.

<br>

### (3) Emotive words

/// Words such as 欲しい {ほしい} and 怖い {こわい}, known as emotive words, express the speaker’s emotional state.

/// Such words are only used in the predicate when the speaker is the topic, or when directly questioning the addressee.

/// They may not be used to describe a third person’s emotional state.

<br>

私は犬が怖いです。//I am afraid of dogs.

あなたは何が怖いですか。//What are you afraid of?

<br>

/// This does not mean that the speaker can never describe a third person’s emotional state.

/// There are other structures to express this. One way is to report what the third person has said.

<br>

メアリーさんは犬が怖いと言いました。//Mary-san said that she (or he) is afraid of dogs.

<br>

/// Another way is for the speaker to report his or her own inference based on direct observation by adding ようだ（です） to the perceived emotion of the third person. 

<br>

メアリーさんは犬が怖いようです。//It looks to me like Mary-san is afraid of dogs.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Making Verbs into Nouns

/// In these structures the objects are nouns

<br>

あの学生は日本語が上手です。//That student is good at Japanese.

私はすしが欲しいです。//I want some sushi.

<br>

/// Because the element before a particle must be in a nominal form, using a verb alone in the object position would not make an acceptable sentence.

<br>

### (1) Nominalizing verbs with こと

/// The following example shows that adding こと immediately after the plain form of the verb changes the verb to a nominal form.

<br>

あの学生は日本語を話すことが上手です。//That student is good at speaking Japanese.

<br>

/// There are two things to remember for now about nominalizing verbs in general.

/// First of all, verbs that are used in the middle rather than the end of a sentence are normally in the plain form.

/// Second, こと must be used immediately after the verb to give this verb a nominal function.

/// こと here has no meaning except its grammatical function of turning a verb into a nominal form.

/// の instead of こと is also possible, although they are not completely interchangeable.

<br>

### (2) Expressing a desire to do things

/// -> [v-stem + たい]

/// The adjective 欲しい {ほしい} is used to express the speaker’s desire for a thing.

<br>

私は寿司が欲しいです。//I want some sushi.

<br>

/// 欲しい can take a noun, but not a verb (even a nominalized verb), as its object in a sentence.

/// Instead, the following structure must be used:

<br>

私は寿司が食べたいです。//I want to eat some sushi.

<br>

/// 食べたい in the above sentence is a derived adjective which expresses that the speaker wants to eat something.

/// To derive this type of adjective, drop ~ます from the polite form of the verb and add ~たい (e.g. たべます to たべたい).

/// The derived form expresses the speaker’s desire to do something. The newly derived form is an adjective, and is therefore conjugated as an adjective:

<br>

私は寿司が食べたくありません。//I don’t want to eat sushi.

私は寿司が食べたかったです。//I wanted to eat sushi.

私は寿司が食べたくありませんでした。//I did not want to eat sushi.

<br>

/// Like 欲しい, this predicate may be used to express the speaker’s desire to do something, as well as to ask another person directly about his or her desire, but it may not be used to express desire on the part of a third person.

<br>

あなたは何が食べたいですか。//What do you want to eat?

<br>

/// The following structures may be used to express the third-person’s desire:

<br>

メアリーさんは寿司が食べたいと言いました。//Mary-san said that she wants to eat sushi.

メアリーさんは寿司が食べたいようです。//It looks to me like Mary-san wants to eat sushi.

<br>

### (3) Expressing the speaker’s plan

/// -> [(v plain form) + つもり]

/// to express the speaker’s plan or to ask directly about the addressee’s plan.

/// This structure may not be used to talk about a third person’s plan.

<br>

メアリーさんは明日、何をするつもりですが。//What do you plan to do tomorrow, Mary-san?

家に帰るつもりです。//I plan to go home.

<br>

/// For the third person’s plan, the following structure may be used.

<br>

メアリーさんは家に帰るつもりだと言いました。//Mary-san said that she plans to go home.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: は and が

/// It is important for learners to understand the differences in how these two particles are used as clearly as possible.

/// the comparison between は and が is made only for the subject が and the topic は. 

<br>

### (1) The topic は

#### The speaker may signal what she or he wants to talk about by bringing it into the topic position, marked by は.

/// Just about anything can be brought to the topic position of a sentence.

<br>

#### When the speaker brings the topic into the sentence,

/// the assumption is that the speaker knows that the audience or addressee understands the referent of the topic.

<br>

#### What the speaker wants to convey to the audience or the addressee is the content described in the comment.

/// In other words, the comment is the new information, and the topic is the information in the sentence that is understood.

<br>

### (2) The subject が

#### In some expressions, the subject and the predicate together constitute a complete unit, called a comment.

/// In these structures, the predicate describes the subject, not the topic.

/// The subject and the predicate together form a single entity, the comment, which describes the topic.

<br>

#### When the subject is used in a sentence,

/// the new information is the subject; the predicate is the given (known) information in the sentence.

/// In this context, in the question about the topic, as well as in the response (that is, when new information is asked for and provided) the noun phrase with が may be called the subject.

<br>

昨日、だれが授業に来ませんでしたか。//Who did not come to the class yesterday?

ずんだもんさんが来ませんでした。//Zundamon-san is the one who did not come.

<br>

### (3) Comparing sentences with the topic and the subject

<br>

日本語の先生はいつもちょうど九時に授業を始めます。//The Japanese teacher always begins the class exactly at 9:00.

<br>

/// The sentence above, using the transitive verb, conveys what the teacher does (the new information is in the comment).

<br>

授業が九時に始まりました。//The class began at 9:00.

<br>

/// The sentence above with the intransitive verb says what it was that began at 9:00 (the new information is the subject).

<br>

#### Other intransitive predicates

/// In fact, the difference noted above can occur with any type of predicate, not just with transitive-intransitive verb pairs.

<br>

ずんだもん先生は九時にいらっしゃいました。//Zundamon-sensei came here at 9:00.

ずんだもん先生がいらっしゃいました。//Zundamon-sensei was the one who came here.

<br>

/// It is common to use the subject が with any kind of intransitive verb, not just the intransitive form of a pair verb, especially when the verb is used with no other information provided.

<br>

雨が降っています。//It’s raining.

授業が始まりです。//The class will begin.

<br>

/// When asking for other information, such as the time when the class begins, the new information is in the predicate.

<br>

授業は何時に始まりますか。//What time will the class begin?

（授業は）九時に始まります。//It will begin at 9:00.

<br>

### (4) The topicalized subject

/// any element may be brought to the topic position and marked with the particle は. This includes the subject.

/// subjects are often topicalized both in speaking and in writing.

/// The following examples show how the subject is topicalized in a series of questions.

<br>

だれが来ましたか。//Who came?

先生がいらっしゃいました。//The teacher was the one who came.

先生はどこからいらっしゃいましたか。//Where did the teacher come from?

（先生は）京都からいらしゃいました。//The teacher came from Kyoto.

<br>

/// What this means is that:

#### Any subject may be topicalized;

#### Not all topics are derived from subjects.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Comparisons

### (1) Comparing two things

#### Reference particle より

/// The particle より indicates that the preceding noun is an item or person being compared to the topic:

<br>

アメリカは日本より大きいです。//America is bigger than Japan.

<br>

/// The adverb もっと may also be used in comparisons, although it is redundant.

/// It need not be included for the sentence to have a comparative meaning.

<br>

アメリカは日本よりもっと大きいです。//America is bigger than Japan.

<br>

/// Using もっと does not change the meaning of the sentence, but it may make the comparative meaning stronger.

<br>

#### Adverb ずっと

/// When the speaker needs to strongly emphasize the degree of the description in the predicate, as in “America is much bigger than Japan,” the adverb ずっと “far more” may be used.

<br>

アメリカは日本よりずっと大きいです。//America is much bigger than Japan.

<br>

/// ずっと and もっと are generally not used together.

<br>

#### Comparative question sentences

/// When asking a question about the two items, the two things to be compared should be listed before forming the question.

/// There are a few different ways to list the items to be compared.

/// アメリカと日本と（とは・で・とで・では・とでは）

<br>

/// The question sentence that follows the list includes the pronoun どちら, which is used only to mean “which of the two.”

/// This pronoun can refer to things, people, or events.

<br>

アメリカと日本と、どちらが大きいですか。//America and Japan, which of the two is big?

<br>

/// The noun 方 {ほう} “side” is often added with の after どちら when comparing two things.

<br>

アメリカと日本とでは、どちらの方が大きいですか。//America and Japan, which side is big?

<br>

#### Answering comparative questions

/// When answering a question about a comparison, it is best to use a structure that parallels the structure of the question.

/// In answering a question that compares two items, the use of 方 is required, although it is optional in the question sentence.

<br>

アメリカと中国とでは、どちら（の方）が大きいですか。//Which is bigger, America or China?

中国の方が大きいです。//China is bigger.

<br>

/// どちらも “both” may be used when the answer does not favor one over the other:

<br>

日本語と英語と、どちらの方が難しいですか。//Which is more difficult, Japanese or English?

どちらも難しいです。//They’re both difficult.

どちらも難しくありません。//Neither of them is difficult.

/// [Literally, “Both are not difficult”]

<br>

#### Comparative sentences with negative predicates

/// If a negative predicate is used in a statement that compares two things, the compared referent is marked by ほど rather than より, as in the following:

<br>

日本はアメリカほど大きくありません。//Japan is not as big as America.

<br>

/// In the above sentence, ほど literally means “degree.”

<br>

#### The experience particle に

/// The particle に has many functions, に is also used to refer to a person who directly experiences a certain feeling described in the predicate.

/// The contrastive は is often used with this に to indicate that this experience is limited to that person (i.e., the one indicated by に).

<br>

私にはカタカナは漢字よりもっと難しいです。//Katakana is more difficult for me than kanji.

あの人の話は私にはよく分かりません。//That person’s talk is quite incomprehensible to me.

<br>

### (2) Comparing more than two things

/// In comparing more than two things or people, the adverb 一番 {いちばん}is placed immediately before the descriptive word.

/// The particle で indicates the boundary of comparison.

<br>

この大学は日本で一番大きい大学です。//This university is the biggest one in Japan.

<br>

#### Forming and responding to a question comparing more than two items

/// When listing things at the beginning of a sentence, the following structures may be used:

<br>

これとそれとあれの中で、どれが一番、安いですか。//Out of this one, that one, and that one over there, which is the cheapest?

<br>

/// The list can be summarized with either ~の中で {なかで} or ~のうちで.

/// It is also possible to provide the category in which a comparison will be made.

/// In this case, the particle で alone or の中で  {なかで} is used:

<br>

飲み物（の中）で、何が一番美味しいですか。//Among all drinks, which is the most delicious?

お茶が一番、美味しいです。//Tea is the most delicious.

<br>

/// The interrogative pronoun in this construction varies depending on what it refers to (どれ, だれ, ど こ, なに, etc).

/// どちら cannot be used in this construction; it is used only when two items are being compared.

<br>

クラスでだれが一番、親切ですか。//Who is the nicest person in class?

アリスさんが一番、親切です。//Alice-san is the nicest.

<br>

/// Particles also vary, depending on what part of the sentence is being questioned:

<br>

友達で、だれに一番よく話しますか。//Which of your friends do you talk to most often?

時雨さんに一番よく話します。//I talk to Shigure-san most often.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Comparing

<br>

チャンさんは中国語も話せますね？　すごいですねえ。でも、日本語と中国語とどっちが難しいですか。//You can speak Chinese, too, right? Wow! But which is more difficult, Japanese or Chinese?

どっちも難しいですね。//They’re both difficult.

<br>

/// どっち is a colloquial spoken form of どちら.

<br>

### (2) Health talk

<br>

クリスさん、どうしましたか。//What’s wrong, Kurisu-san?

ちょっと、頭が痛いんです。//I have a bit of a headache.

それはいけませんね。お大事に。//Oh, dear, that’s too bad. Do take care.

<br>

/// どうしましたか is a fixed expression used for an equivalent expression in English, “What happened?” 

/// In Japanese, 何 {なん・なに} is used for a very specific thing, but for a vague or openended thing, どう is used.

<br>

/// ちょっと is a colloquial expression of 少し {すこし}, “a little.”

<br>

/// それはいけませんね expresses that the speaker feels badly about the addressee’s poor condition.

<br>

/// お大事に {おだいじに} expresses the speaker’s hope that the addressee will take care of him/herself, because the speaker knows the addressee is not feeling well.

<br>

### (3) When the speaker does not know the answer

<br>

あの背が高い人と低い人と、どちらが時雨さんですか。//Which of those people is Shigure-san, the tall one or the short one?

ええと・・・。さあ、僕にはよく分かりません。すみません。//Let’s see… Uh, it’s hard for me to tell. I’m sorry.

ああ、大丈夫ですよ。ナースロボさんに聞きますから。//Oh, that’s all right. Don’t worry, I’ll ask Naasurobo-san.

<br>

/// ええと is a vocalization that indicates that the speaker is trying to decide or recall what to say.

/// In this case, the speaker is trying to come up with the correct answer.

/// The first syllable of the word may be drawn out while the speaker tries to find the answer or something to say.

<br>

#### 大丈夫です

/// When used in a question as in 大丈夫ですか {だいじょうぶですか} “Are you all right?” the speaker asks if the addressee is all right (health, general circumstances, current state, etc.).

/// 大丈夫です {だいじょうぶです} may either be the response to this question (“I’m OK”), or an expression used by the speaker to ease the worry of the addressee (“That’s OK”).

<br>

#### スミスさんに聞きますから {スミスさんに きき ますから}

/// This is almost like giving a reason as an afterthought.

/// から is the conjunction used to give a reason, but the way it is used here is incomplete.

/// If this clause came before 大丈夫です, it would mean “Because I’ll ask Smith-san, I’ll be all right.”

/// Note that the polite form rather than the plain form is used before から. When using this structure as an afterthought, this is not uncommon.

# Stage 1-8 Plain Forms of Predicates

## 1: Different Speech Styles of Predicates

### (1) The goal of this section

/// In Japanese, verbs, adjectives, and the copula conjugate, and all predicates have both plain and polite forms.

/// Everything that can be expressed in the polite form can be expressed in the plain form and vice versa.

<br>

### (2) Polite forms

#### In speaking

/// Polite forms are used in formal situations such as classrooms, conferences, speeches, etc., in which the speaker judges it appropriate to maintain some kind of social or psychological distance between him/herself and the addressee(s).

/// These forms are also used to address people whom the speaker does not know well, even when the situation is not that formal.

<br>

#### In writing

/// The polite form is used in personal writing such as letters, postcards, or e-mail messages, although the plain form may also be used in these cases (see below). The polite form may be used in letters, etc. even when the writer knows the receiver of the mail quite well.

/// This may be because things such as letters and postcards put some distance between the two parties involved.

/// Novels or essays, which are normally written in an impersonal style by employing the plain form, may use the polite form in some cases.

/// The use of the polite form in such works conveys the sense that the author is talking directly to the readers (i.e., narratives).

<br>

### (3) Plain forms

#### In speaking

/// Plain forms are used in casual conversations: when speaking to one’s family members and close friends, for instance.

/// The use of the plain form indicates that there is little to no personal distance between the two parties involved.

/// In some cases, an individual who is in an authoritative position may use the plain forms to her or his subordinates. This is particularly true of male speakers.

<br>

#### In writing

/// The plain form is used in places where little to no personal relation is considered.

/// It can be used in impersonal writing such as newspapers, essays, journals, etc. E-mail messages, or at times letters and postcards, to close friends and family members are like talking, so the plain form may be used.

<br>

#### Structural requirement

/// Using the plain form in some structures may be grammatically required regardless of the speech style.

/// For instance, predicates used in the non-final position are normally in the plain form even when the speech is in the polite style.

<br>

彼は日本語を話すことが上手です。//He is good at speaking Japanese.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Preparation for Conjugating Plain Predicates

### (1) Base forms

/// All conjugations are based on certain predicate forms, which are termed base forms in this course.

/// Some—not all—base forms have the same form as the dictionary forms, but differ in purpose, as defined below:

<br>

/// - Plain forms: these forms have different aspectual forms.

<br>

/// - Dictionary forms: these forms are used to represent each predicate in dictionaries and citations.

/// They thus have no aspectual forms, as plain forms do. Derived forms cannot be dictionary forms.

<br>

/// - Base forms: these forms are the base for all predicate conjugations.

/// Like dictionary forms, base forms do not have aspectual forms.

/// But unlike dictionary forms, derived forms (potential, passive, causative, たい-forms, etc.) are the base form for further conjugations.

<br>

#### The copula

/// The base form of the copula is だ. The copula is needed for conjugations of all nominal predicates.

<br>

僕は一年生だ。//I am a freshman.

この部屋はきれいだ。//This room is clean.

<br>

#### Adjectives

/// Since adjectives conjugate (the last ~い being the element that goes through the changes), the copula is not needed for conjugation in the plain form.

/// The base form of an adjective is that adjective without the copula.

<br>

この本は高い。//This book is expensive.

<br>

/// Derived adjectives such as the たい-form (indicating the speaker’s desire) are also base forms.

<br>

日本に行きたい。//I want to go to Japan.

<br>

#### Verbs

/// Some base forms are the same as the dictionary forms, but not all base forms are dictionary forms.

/// For instance, some base forms are derived by adding or inserting suffixes;

/// these derived forms are the base forms for conjugations, but they are not dictionary forms.

<br>

私は毎日、日本語を話す。//I speak Japanese every day.

<br>

### (2) Verb grouping

/// Verbs are classified into three different groups according to the final syllable of the base form.

/// In order to be able to conjugate verbs in different aspects and forms, it is necessary to learn which of these groups a given verb belongs to.

<br>

/// There are far fewer rules than there are different derived forms.

/// Trying to learn conjugations by rote is highly inefficient and often leads to inaccuracy.

<br>

/// Group 1: The verbs in this group always end with る. The syllable immediately before る contains the vowels i or e.

/// Group 2: All verbs that end with a syllable other than る are in this group （く, ぐ, す, む, ぬ, ぶ, つ, う）

///          There are some verbs that end with る in this group. In this case the syllable immediately before る contains the vowels u, o, or a

///          There are a small number of verbs that end with る and contain the vowels i or e in the syllable before る (same as Group 1), but nevertheless are Group 2 verbs

/// Group 3: The two verbs する and くる and compound verbs with する and くる all belong to this group

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: たべる, みる, おきる, ねる

/// G2: かく, およぐ, はなす, よむ, しぬ, よぶ, まつ, かう

///     わかる, おこる, うる

///     かえる, はしる

/// G3: する, くる

<br>

#### Points to remember about verb grouping

/// There are no exceptions to Group 3. The verbs that contain する and くる are always in Group 3.

/// There are also no exceptions for verbs ending with a syllable other than る. These verbs are always in Group 2.

/// When verbs end with る and the syllable immediately before る contains the vowels u, o, or a, they are always in Group 2. There are no exceptions to this rule. For instance, the following verbs are in Group 2: わかる, おこる, うる

/// When a verb ends with る, and the syllable immediately before る contains the vowels i or e, then the verb is most likely in Group 1. For example, the following verbs belong to Group 1: たべる, みる, おしえる

/// There are a few verbs ending in る that belong to Group 2, even though the syllable immediately before る contains the vowels i or e. There is no system for determining which of these verbs are in Group 2. For instance, きる “to wear” is a Group 1 verb, while きる “to cut” belongs to Group 2.

<br>

/// In the same way, いる “to exist” is a Group 1 verb, but いる “to need” is a Group 2 verb. Because of these variations, the group number of each verb is given in the summary of the new vocabulary at the end of each chapter in the Workbooks from this chapter onward.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Plain Positive Imperfectives

/// The plain positive imperfective forms have the same form as the base forms.

/// This particular aspect of these forms is called the “positive imperfective form.”

<br>

#### Nominal predicates

/// Since nouns cannot change forms, the aspectual differentiation of the nominal predicate must rely on the conjugation of the copula.

/// For the nominal predicate, therefore, use the base form of the copula, which is だ, to indicate the positive imperfective aspect.

<br>

私は学生だ。//I am a student.

<br>

/// Use the same structure when an adjectival noun is used in the predicate.

<br>

この部屋は静かだ。//This room is quiet.

<br>

#### Adjectival predicates

/// While the copula だ in the nominal predicate is required for the plain positive imperfective aspect, it is not a necessary element in the adjectival predicate for this aspect.

/// Since adjectives do conjugate for aspects, adjectival predicates do not need to rely on the conjugation of the copula.

/// The copula in the adjectival predicate is necessary only for the polite form.

<br>

この本は大きい。//This book is big.

<br>

/// The predicate of the following sentence is a derived adjective.

<br>

寿司が食べたい。//I want to eat sushi.

<br>

/// When an adjective modifies a noun in the predicate, it belongs to the nominal predicate. だ, therefore, is necessary in this case.

<br>

これは大きい本だ。//This is a big book.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates

/// As mentioned above, the plain positive imperfective aspect of a verb in the predicate appears to be the same as the base form.

<br>

私は毎日テレビを見る。//I watch TV every day.

パクさんは明日、日本に行く。//Park-san will go to Japan tomorrow.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Plain Negative Imperfectives

#### Nominal predicates

/// -> [だ → ではない or じゃない]

/// The rule for changing the base form of the copula to the plain negative imperfective aspectual form is as follows. 

/// As in the polite form, the use of じゃ here is a little more colloquial than では.

<br>

僕は学生ではない。//I am not a student.

僕は学生じゃない。//I am not a student.

<br>

/// When an adjectival noun is used in the predicate, use the same structure.

<br>

これは大切じゃない。//This is not important.

<br>

#### Adjectival predicates

/// -> [~い → ~く ない]

/// To change the base form of an adjective to the plain negative imperfective aspectual form, use the following rule:

<br>

この本は高くない。//This book is not expensive.

この学生はあまりよくない。//This college is not very good.

<br>

/// See the following example with a derived adjective:

<br>

日本に行きたくない。//I don’t want to go to Japan.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates

/// The following are the rules for changing the base form of a verb to its plain negative imperfective aspectual form.

/// The verb group must first be identified before applying these rules.

<br>

/// Group 1: [る → ない]

/// Group 2: change the final vowel of the last syllable {u} to {a} and then add ない

///             Verbs that end with う belong to Group 2, the plain negative imperfective of a う-ending verb is as follows: かう → かわない; つかう → つかわない

/// Group 3: [くる → こない], [する → しない]

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: 食べない

/// G2: 書かない

/// G3: こない, しない

<br>

テレビは見ない。//I won’t watch TV.

お金を使わない。//I won’t use any money.

<br>

#### The verb ある

/// The verb ある has a somewhat modified conjugation.

/// Although ある is a Group 2 verb, its plain negative imperfective form is ない rather than あらない (the form that would result if ある followed the rule).

<br>

今、僕はお金がない。//I don’t have any money right now.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Plain Positive Perfectives

#### Nominal predicates

/// -> [だ → だった]

/// The following rule changes the base form of the copula into the plain positive perfective form:

<br>

私は学生だった。//I was a student.

あの車はきれいだった。//The car was clean.

<br>

#### Adjectival predicates

/// -> [~い → ~かった]

/// The following rule changes the base form of an adjective into the plain positive perfective form:

<br>

あの本は高かった。//That book was expensive.

あの映画はよかった。//That movie was good.

日本に行きたかった。//I wanted to go to Japan.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates

/// The plain positive perfective forms of verbs have more rules than most other forms.

/// However, since these same rules can be applied to other forms, it is very useful to learn them.

<br>

/// Group 1: [る → た]

/// Group 2: [く → いた], [ぐ → いだ], [す → した], [む, ぬ, ぶ → んだ], [つ, う, る → った]

/// Group 3: [する → した, くる → きた]

/// The only exception to the rule above is the verb 行く {いく}. Although this verb ends with く, the plain positive perfective form is 行った {いった}.

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: 食べた

/// G2: 書いた

///     泳いだ

///     話した

///     読んだ, 死んだ, 遊んだ

///     待った, 使った, 帰った

/// G3: した, きた

<br>

朝ご飯にパンを食べた。//I ate a piece of bread for breakfast.

ืื時雨さんと映画に行った。//I went to a movie with Shigure-san.

<br>

/// There is only one verb that ends with ぬ. That verb is 死ぬ {しぬ}, which means “to die.”

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 6: Plain Negative Perfectives

/// There is only one rule for this form; it applies to all predicate types.

<br>

/// First change the base form of the predicate to the plain negative imperfective form, which always ends in ない. 

/// Then change the final ~い to ~かった.

<br>

#### Nominal predicates

<br>

私は学生じゃなかった。//I wasn’t a student.

部屋はきれいじゃなかった。//The room was not clean.

<br>

#### Adjectival predicates

<br>

あの本は高くなかった。//That book wasn’t expensive.

あの本はよくなかった。//That book wasn’t good.

日本に行きたくなかった。//I didn’t want to go to Japan.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates

<br>

昨日はテレビを見なかった。//I didn’t watch TV yesterday.

去年、日本に行かなかった。//I didn’t go to Japan last year.

<br>

## 7: Plain Volitional Forms

/// sentences with the volitional copula express that something is highly probable.

<br>

#### Nominal predicates

/// -> [だ → だろう]

<br>

あの人は日本人だろう。//That person is probably Japanese.

あの人は親切だろう。//That person is probably kind.

<br>

#### Adjectival predicates (reference only)

/// -> [い → かろう]

/// The plain volitional forms of adjectives derived from base forms are not commonly used except for in some fixed expressions.

/// The plain volitional form of adjectives is nevertheless introduced here to make its existence known, but this form need not be practiced, at least for the time being.

<br>

/// 大きい 大きかろう, いい よかろう

<br>

#### Sentences with the plain volitional form of the copula

/// A sentence followed by the plain volitional form of the copula expresses the speaker’s inference of a high possibility:

<br>

この本は高いだろう。//This book is probably expensive.

ナースロボさんはアメリカ人じゃないだろう。//Naasurobo-san is probably not an American.

ナースロボさんは日本に行かなかっただろう。//Naasurobo-san probably did not go to Japan.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates

/// The plain volitional verb forms have other uses in addition to the meaning of “Let’s do such-and-such.”

/// All verbs therefore have the volitional forms, although in some cases the volitional forms may not be used for the meaning of “Let’s do such-and-such.”

<br>

/// Group 1: [る → よう]

/// Group 2: change the final vowel {u} to the double {o (oo)}

/// Group 3: [する → しよう], [くる→こよう]

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: 見よう

/// G2: 行こう

/// G3: しよう, こよう

<br>

テレビを見よう。//Let’s watch TV.

一緒に勉強しよう。//Let’s study together.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 8: Speech Levels

### (1) Politeness and honorifics

/// Knowing when to use honorifics is not as straightforward as one might imagine.

/// Some use of honorifics is socially expected from everyone, but in some cases, the speaker chooses to use honorifics simply to be polite regardless of the situation.

<br>

/// There are certain tendencies—and these are only tendencies—concerning the use of honorifics:

/// - Women tend to use honorifics more frequently than men;

/// - The use of honorifics, especially among young people, seems to be decreasing recently in daily life, although people are still expected to use them once they become adults or enter the workplace;

/// - Honorifics may sometimes be used solely for the purpose of politeness rather than to acknowledge the superior position of the topic; for example, when addressing a stranger.

<br>

/// The honorific system affects verbs most noticeably, but other parts of speech such as nouns, adjectives, and the copula are also affected.

<br>

/// Do not confuse politeness, 丁寧語 {ていねいご}, with honorifics, 敬語 {けいご}. They are related, but the following difference must be noted.

/// Politeness has to do with the relationship between the speaker and the addressee. The use of honorifics, on the other hand, has to do with the relationship between the speaker and the topic of the sentence.

<br>

/// The use of ~ます or です at the end of a sentence indicates the polite form.

/// The use of an honorific verb indicates the speaker’s respect towards the topic, which may or may not be the person the speaker is addressing.

/// Honorific verbs therefore have polite forms and plain forms.

<br>

/// The diagram below illustrates the relationship between the speaker and either the topic or the addressee.

/// いらっしゃ (for topic) る (for addressee)

/// いらっしゃい (for topic) ます (for addressee)

<br>

先生は今日は研究室にいらっしゃる。//The teacher is in her office today.

先生は今日は研究室にいらっしゃいます。//The teacher is in her office today.

<br>

#### Talking with and about family members

/// When a speaker talks to a close friend or a family member, the plain form should be used.

/// All family members are considered to be うち-group, so neither the polite form nor honorifics are used when talking to them or about them.

<br>

### (2) Different politeness degrees of negative predicates

/// There are two ways to make negatives polite. The first way is to use the polite negatives, as follows:

<br>

私はずんだもんではありません。//I am not Zundamon.

この本はよくありません。//This book is not good.

私はお金がありません。//I don’t have money.

<br>

/// The second way to make negatives polite is simply to add です to the plain negative form.

/// Since this negative form is less formal than the polite form, it is called the casual-polite form. See the following examples:

<br>

私はずんだまんじゃないです。//I am not Zundamon.

この本はよくないです。//This book is not good.

私はお金がないです。//I don’t have money.

<br>

/// The degrees of politeness of these negative forms are as follows (in order from most to least polite):

/// Nominal predicate: ではありません > じゃありません > ではないです > じゃないです

/// Adjectival predicate: よくありません > よくないです

/// Verbal predicate: ありません > ないです

<br>

/// ~ないです is not used as often for verbal predicates as it is for nominal and adjectival predicates.

/// However, the use of ないです to mean “I don’t have” (as in 私はお金がないです) is more frequent than the use of ~ないです with other verbs

<br>

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Casual speech: asking a question and responding

<br>

寿司、好き？//You like sushi?

うん、もちろん、大好き。//Yeah, of course, I love it.

<br>

#### Particle deletion in casual speech

/// Particles are often deleted in conversation, but they are deleted even more frequently in casual speech.

/// Particles such as the topic は, the subject が, the object が, and the object を are deleted much more often than others such as に, で, and から.

<br>

#### Question sentences: absence of the copula and the question particle

/// For both female and male speakers, the use of the copula or the question particle か is not necessary in question sentences.

<br>

/// うん or ん is a very casual way to indicate agreement.

/// You may not even hear the first う in some cases. You may hear only the sound ん.

/// The actual sound is difficult to describe, so it is important to hear a native speaker say it, either personally or via sound files.

<br>

/// もちろん is a conversational word that means “of course.”

<br>

### (2) Female and male casual conversation

/// In casual speaking, the differences between male and female speakers surface more prominently than in formal conversation. Such differences are usually in word choice, sentence-final particles, and the use of the copula.

<br>

この鞄、随分、高いわねえ。//This bag is pretty expensive, isn’t it?

本当に高いねえ。これ、どこの鞄？//It sure is. Where was it made?

アメリカのじゃない？//Isn’t it American?

うん、そうだよ。アメリカのだよ。//Yeah, you’re right. It’s American.

<br>

#### The sentence-final particle わ

/// The sentence-final particle わ is used only in conversation by female speakers.

/// This particle conveys that the assertion of the speaker is a new discovery.

/// In the case of a nominal predicate, だ must be used with わ.

<br>

あの人は先生だわ。//That person is the teacher.

この本は本当に難しいわ。//This book is really difficult.

明日、行くわ。//I want to tell you that I will be going tomorrow.

<br>

/// じゃない？ at the end of a sentence indicates that the speaker is fairly sure, but not 100% certain, that the information is correct.

/// Therefore, じゃない is used to obtain a confirmation from the listener. A rising intonation should be used.

<br>

#### Presence of だ

/// だ is used after a nominal predicate when another particle is present (よ in this case).

/// The use of だ in the last line indicates that the speaker is a male.

/// A female speaker would normally not use だ if it is the last element of a sentence (e.g. そうだ).

/// A female speaker uses だ followed by a particle, as in そうだわ.

<br>

チャンさん、これ、食べない？//Chang-san, won’t you eat this?

ううん。今は要らないよ。//No, thanks. I don’t want it right now.

これは？//How about this?

それも要らないよ。//I don’t want that, either.

<br>

### (3) Responses by female speakers

<br>

クリスさん、これ、食べない？//Kurisu-san, won’t you eat this?

ううん。今は要らないわ。//No, thanks. I don’t want it right now.

これは？//How about this?

それも要らないわ。//I don’t want that, either.

<br>

/// ううん is a very casual way of saying “No.” It is often accompanied by a quick side-to-side head movement.

/// This response is especially difficult to transcribe, so it is important for the learner to hear native speakers (like those in the sound files) utter this response and not to depend on the written representation alone.

/// Imitating the native speaker’s intonation of this response is important.

<br>

### (4) Urging the other

<br>

さあ、行こうか。//OK. Shall we go now?

今？　一時行かない？//Now? How about at 1:00?

一時？　いいよ。//1:00? All right.

<br>

/// さあ here indicates that the speaker is suggesting, or even urging, the addressee to do a certain thing, “going” in the above case, at the time of the speech.

/// さあ, in this case, must be pronounced with a short falling tone.

/// さあ spoken with a longer rising tone is used while trying to think of an answer (one which the speaker probably does not know)stage １，９。

# Stage 1-9 Bridging Stage 1 and Stage 2

## 1: When to Use Plain Forms

### (1) Plain forms in the final and non-final positions

#### Final positions

/// Plain forms are used for different functions.

/// In speaking, they are used in the final position of a sentence to indicate that the speaker and the addressee are in a close relationship (e.g., close friends, family members).

<br>

/// When plain forms are used in the final position of a sentence in writing, it indicates that the writing is impersonal.

/// That is, the writer is not addressing any particular individual (e.g., newspaper articles, essays).

<br>

#### Non-final positions

/// For predicates in the non-final position of a sentence, the plain predicate is used in most cases, regardless of the speech (or writing) style.

<br>

### (2) Examples of predicates in the non-final position

#### Nominalizing verbs

/// when a verb is used in a non-final position, such as the topic or object position of a sentence, it must be in the plain form with the functional noun こと (this noun is therefore called a nominalizer).

<br>

私は日本語が好きです。//I like the Japanese language.

私は日本語ができます。//I have some ability in Japanese.

日本語は易しいです。//Japanese is easy.

<br>

私は日本語を話すことが好きです。//I like to speak Japanese.

私は日本語を話すことができます。//I can speak Japanese.

日本語を話すことは易しいです。//Speaking Japanese is easy.

<br>

/// the verb 話す {はなす} is used in a non-final position in the same sentences.

/// こと follows the verb 話す to nominalize it

<br>

#### Reporting what others have said

/// When reporting what others have said, the verb 言う {いう} “to say” is used.

/// The particle と connects the content of the quote and the final verb, 言う.

/// If it is not a direct quote, the content of the quote should be expressed in the plain form.

/// The following examples illustrate the different predicate types and aspectual forms used in the content of the quote.

<br>

時雨さんは日本語が好きだと言いました。//Shigure-san said that she likes the Japanese language.

時雨さんは日本語は易しくないと言いました。//Shigure-san said that Japanese isn’t easy.

時雨さんは日本語ができたと言いました。//Shigure-san said that he once was able to speak Japanese.

<br>

/// To ask what another person said, use the following structure:

<br>

時雨さんは何と言いましたか。//What did Shigure-san say?

<br>

#### Conveying the speaker’s thought

/// the speaker’s opinion can be conveyed by the verb 思う {おもう} “to think.”

/// The content of the speaker’s thought must be in the plain form.

/// Remember that this verb, 思う “to think,” is used by the speaker only to express his or her own thoughts or to ask another person directly about their opinion.

/// 思う may not be used to express a third person’s thoughts.

/// Because of this, even when the first-person pronoun is not used in the topic position, it should be understood that the topic of the sentence is the speaker.

<br>

私はあの人は日本人だと思います。//I think that that person is Japanese.

日本語は易しいと思います。//I think that Japanese is easy.

ずんだまんさんは明日、日本に行くと思います。//I think that Zundamon-san will go to Japan tomorrow.

<br>

/// To ask for an opinion, どう is used rather than 何.

/// どう is normally used for general information while 何 {なに・なん} is used for specific information. Compare the following two question sentences:

<br>

ずんだもんさんは日本語についてどう思いますか。//What do you think of Japanese, Zundamon-san?

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

#### Hearing

/// The verb 聞く {きく} has two meanings, “to hear” (or “to listen”) and “to ask.”

/// When discussing something he or she heard, the speaker can report the content in the plain form.

<br>

私はあの人は日本人だと聞きました。//I heard that that person is Japanese.

ずんだまんさんは昨日、日本に行かなかったと聞きました。//I heard that Zundamon-san didn’t go to Japan yesterday.

<br>

/// To ask about what the addressee has heard, どんなこと is used. In this case, the particle を is used, but not と.

<br>

あなたはどんなことを聞きましたか。//What did you hear?

<br>

/// When asking the exact content of what the addressee has heard, 何 {なん} is used. Here, too, を, not と, is used:

<br>

あなたはずんだまんさんに何を聞きましたか。//What did you hear from Zundamon-san?

あなたはずんだまんさんから何を聞きましたか。//What did you hear from Zundamon-san?

<br>

/// In responding to the two questions above, と is placed between the content and the verb 聞く {きく}.

<br>

日本語の試験は易しかったと聞きました。//I heard that the Japanese examination was easy.

<br>

#### Asking

/// When reporting what one has asked others, the reported content must be in the form of a question sentence ending in the particle か.

/// In this case, the use of the particle と between the content of the question and the final verb 聞く {きく} becomes unnecessary.

<br>

私はルームメートに日本語の試験は易しかったか聞きました。//I asked my roommate if the Japanese examination was easy.

私はずんだまんさんに明日、日本に行くか聞きました。//I asked Zundamon-san if she would go to Japan tomorrow.

<br>

/// The copula should not be used after the noun in the nominal predicate of the question clause:

<br>

私はずんだまんさんにあの人は日本人か聞きました。//I asked Zundamon-san whether that person is Japanese.

<br>

/// Sentences with and without と differ slightly in meaning when reporting questions. 

/// When と is used, the sentence reports how the question was posed.

<br>

/// To ask exactly what question was posed to another person, use 何 {なん}.

/// In this case, the particle と is used after 何 {なん}

<br>

あなたはずんだもんさんに何と聞きましたか。//How did you ask Zundamon-san?

私はずんだもんさんに日本語の試験は易しかったかと聞きました。//I asked Zundamon-san, ‘Was the Japanese exam easy?’

<br>

/// To ask for the content of what the addressee asked, use どんなこと.

/// In this case, the particle を is used for どんなこと

<br>

あなたはどんなことを聞きましたか。//What kinds of things did you ask?

日本について聞きました。//I asked him about Japan.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Complex Structures

### (1) About complex sentences

/// A sentence that contains only one predicate is called a simple sentence.

/// A complex sentence consists of at least two clauses.

/// These two clauses form a relationship, with one being the independent clause (also called the main clause) and the other being the dependent clause (or subordinate clause).

<br>

/// An independent (main) clause is one that would function as a complete sentence even if the dependent (subordinate) clause were not joined to it.

/// Unlike independent clauses, dependent clauses cannot be used in isolation. They depend on the presence of independent clauses to complete their meaning.

<br>

/// The function of a dependent clause is similar to that of an adjective or adverb, though on the level of a clause rather than a word or a phrase.

/// Therefore, dependent clauses are classified either as adverbial or adjectival clauses.

<br>

### (2) Adjectival clauses

/// A noun or noun phrase may be modified by an adjective, an adjectival noun, or a noun, as explained earlier.

/// A noun (phrase) can also be modified by a clause.

/// the element modifying a noun (phrase) is always placed before the noun (phrase) that it modifies.

<br>

/// A clause that modifies a noun or noun phrase is called an adjectival clause because of its function.

<br>

#### Two topics in one sentence

/// A sentence that contains an adjectival or an adverbial clause consists of at least two clauses, one of them dependent and the other independent.

/// Each of these clauses may have the same topic (subject, in the case of English) or a different one.

<br>

/// when the dependent and independent clauses have different topics, が is used for the topic of the dependent clause and は for the topic of the independent clause.

/// When the topics are identical, は is used once, and the topic is not repeated.

<br>

/// No particle is needed between the verb in the adjectival clause and the noun it modifies.

<br>

私は昨日、買った本を読みました。//I read the book that I bought yesterday.

私は昨日、ずんだもんさんが買った本を読みました。//I read the book that Zundamon-san bought yesterday.

<br>

### (3) Adverbial clauses joined by から

<br>

昨日、私は病気でした。だから、授業を休みました。//I was sick yesterday. Therefore, I didn’t go to class.

<br>

/// These two separate sentences can be joined into a single sentence that consists of a dependent clause and an independent clause.

/// The function of this dependent clause is adverbial, because it gives the reason for the independent clause; it is therefore an adverbial clause.

/// The predicate in an adverbial clause is normally in the plain form.

/// The two clauses are joined by the clausal conjunction から.

<br>

昨日、私は病気だったから、授業を休みました。//Because I was sick yesterday, I didn’t go to class.

<br>

/// When two clauses are joined by the conjunction から, the first clause always indicates the reason for the consequence expressed in the main clause.

<br>

/// The adverbial clause must come before the independent clause, just as an adverb must be used before the word it modifies.

/// Reversing the order of the two clauses is unacceptable in Japanese.

<br>

/// the interrogative pronouns どうして and なぜ may be used to ask the reasons for certain consequences.

/// When used in this way, なぜ is more formal than どうして. Very colloquially, なんで may be used as well.

/// Since these interrogative pronouns have an adverbial function, no particle is necessary.

/// Although the interrogative pronouns in the examples below are in the sentence-initial position, they may be used anywhere in the sentence except at the end.

<br>

どうして、あなたは昨日、授業を休みましたか。//Why were you absent from class yesterday?

なぜ、あなたは昨日、授業を休みましたか。//Why were you absent from class yesterday?

なんで、あなたは昨日、授業を休みましたか。//Why were you absent from class yesterday?

<br>

私は病気だったから、授業を休みました。//I was sick yesterday, so I didn’t go to class.

<br>

/// As in sentences with adjectival clauses, when the two clauses have different topics, the topic in the adverbial clause is marked by が.

/// The main topic marked by は may be used in the sentence-initial position, or after the conjunction から:

<br>

昨日、私は、子供が病気だったから、授業を休みました。//My child was sick, so I didn’t go to class yesterday.

<br>

#### Clauses in conversation

/// In responding to a question in actual conversation, the main clause is often deleted since it would be a repetition of the question.

/// です in the second response abbreviates the entire independent clause.

<br>

どうして、昨日、授業を休みましたか。//Why were you absent from class yesterday?

子供が病気だったからです。//Because my child was sick.

<br>

#### In a more polite situation

/// In a very polite situation, it is not incorrect to use the polite form of the predicate in the adverbial clause.

/// However, this would be too polite for normal conversation.

<br>

昨日、私は、子供が病気でしたから、授業を休みました。//I didn’t come to class yesterday because my child was sick.

<br>

### (4) Adverbial clauses joined by 時 {とき}, 前に {まえに}, and 後で {あとで}

<br>

昨日、私は雪ノ下さんに会いました。その時に、私は留学について話しました。//I met Yukinoshita-san yesterday. At that time, I told him about my study-abroad.

昨日、私は雪ノ下さんに会いました。その前に、私はお茶を買いました。//I met Yukinoshita-san yesterday. Before that, I bought tea.

私は雪ノ下さんに会いました。そのあとで、先生にメールを書きました。//I met Yukinoshita-san. After that, I wrote an e-mail message to my teacher.

<br>

/// The sentences joined by each conjunction above may be changed into complex sentences by using 時, 前に, and 後で as clausal conjunctions.

/// The use of particle に after the conjunction 時 is optional.

<br>

私は雪ノ下さんに会った時に、留学について話しました。//When I ran into Yukinoshita-san, I told him about my study-abroad.

<br>

/// Before the conjunction 前に, the verb must always be in the imperfective form, regardless of the aspect of the main clause.

<br>

私は雪ノ下さんに会う前に、お茶を買いました。//I bought tea before I met Yukinoshita-san.

私は雪ノ下さんに会う前に、お茶を買います。//I will buy tea before I meet Yukinoshita-san.

<br>

/// Before the conjunction 後で, the verb must always be in the perfective form, regardless of the aspect of the main clause.

<br>

私は雪ノ下さんに会った後で、先生にメールを書きました。//After I met Yukinoshita-san, I wrote an e-mail message to my teacher.

私は雪ノ下さんに会った後で、先生にメールを書きます。//After I meet Yukinoshita-san, I will write an e-mail message to my teacher.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Complex Predicates

### (1) What are complex predicates?

/// One of the defining features of Japanese sentence structure is the use of the complex predicate to express the speaker’s intention, view, etc. by adding another element to the existing predicate.

/// Properly used, complex predicates add important nuance to sentences and discourses.

/// As noted, adding ~んだ to a statement sentence indicates that the sentence explains either a previously mentioned sentence or one that will follow.

/// And adding ~んだ to a question sentence changes the nuance to indicate that the speaker wants to confirm a certain assertion or inference with the addressee.

<br>

/// adding ~ようだ to an existing predicate indicates that the idea in that predicate is the speaker’s inference drawn from his or her observations.

<br>

### (2) つもりだ

/// adding the functional noun つもりだ to the existing predicate expresses the speaker’s intent.

/// つもりだ may only be used to express the intent of the speaker or that of an addressee if used as a direct question.

/// つもりだ may not be used in the complex predicate to express a third person’s intention.

<br>

チャンさんは明日、何をするつもりですか。宿題をするつもりですか。//What are you planning to do tomorrow, Chang-san? Are you going to do your homework?

宿題はしないつもりですが、買い物に行くつもりです。//I’m not planning to do my homework, but I’m going to go shopping.

<br>

/// One way to ask about or state a third person’s intention is to use the verb 思う {おもう}.

<br>

時雨さんは明日、何をすると思いますか。//What do you think Shigure-san will do tomorrow?

宿題をすると思います。//I think he’ll do his homework.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) だろう

/// the volitional form of the copula is used to express the speaker’s view that the content preceding だろう （でしょう） is likely to be true.

/// The following examples are with the verbal, adjectival, and nominal predicates, in that order.

/// Aspectual differences are expressed in the predicate before だろう.

<br>

チャンさんは日本語が多分、上手に話せたでしょう。//Chang-san could probably speak Japanese well.

来年の日本語の授業は易しくないでしょう。//Next year’s Japanese class will probably be not easy.

<br>

/// When だろう（でしょう） is used following a nominal predicate, the copula だ is not used:

<br>

多分、あの学生は三年生でしょう。//That student is probably a third grader.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) かもしれない

/// Complex predicates with かもしれない （かもしれません） convey less certainty than those using だろう.

/// For sentences with かもしれない, the adverb もしかしたら “by chance” may be used, although it is optional.

/// As with だろう （でしょう）, the nominal predicate should not be accompanied by だ.

/// Aspectual differences are expressed in the predicate before かもしれない.

<br>

あの学生はもしかしたら、三年生かもしれません。//Perhaps that student is a third grader.

もしかしたら、チャンさんは日本語が上手に話せないかもしれません。//Chang-san may not be able to speak Japanese well.

去年の日本語の授業はもっと易しかったかもしれません。//The Japanese class last year might have been easier.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: New Forms

### (1) Conjunctive forms

/// The conjunctive form, also called the て-form because of its ending, has been used from early on in this course, although the rules for its use were not explained in detail.

/// The rules governing the conjunctive form are exactly the same as those for the plain positive perfective form, except for the last syllable:

///      instead of ending the form with た or だ, as in the plain positive perfective, the ending should be て or で.

<br>

#### Copula

/// [だ → で]

/// - Ex 先生だ → 先生で

<br>

#### Adjective

/// [い → くて]

/// - Ex たかい → たかくて

<br>

#### Verb

/// Group 1: [る → て]

/// Group 2: [く → いて],

///          [ぐ → いで],

///          [す → して],

///          [む,ぬ,ぶ → んで],

///          [つ,う,る → って],

///          Exception [いく → いって]

/// Group 3: [する → して], [くる → きて]

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: たべる → たべて

/// G2: かく → かいて

///     およぐ → およいで

///     はなす → はなして

///     よむ → よんで, しぬ → しんで, あそぶ → あそんで

///     まつ → まって, かう → かって, かえる → かえって

<br>

/// *Negative [~ない → ~なくて], [Vない → Vないで]

/// -Ex 先生じゃなくて, よくなくて, たべなくて

///     たべないで

<br>

/// The negative imperfectives of predicates, all of which end with ない, are formed in the same way as adjectives.

/// Verbs have two different negative conjunctive forms.

<br>

/// The conjunctive form is used with various elements; each combination has its own meaning.

/// The following summarizes the combinations that have already been introduced in the earlier chapters.

<br>

#### Use of the conjunctive form 1

/// Because the conjunction と may not be used to join predicates, the conjunctive form of the predicate is used instead.

/// The following examples illustrate the use of the conjunctive form in nominal, adjectival, and verbal predicates, in that order.

<br>

私はこの大学の学生で、二年生です。//I am a student at this college and a sophomore.

このコンピュータは安くて、とてもいいです。//This computer is cheap and also very good.

私は朝、早く起きて、宿題をしました。//I got up early in the morning and did my homework.

<br>

#### Use of the conjunctive form 2

/// A construction consisting of the conjunctive form and いる is used to express a continuous aspect of the predicate.

<br>

今学期、日本語を勉強しています。//I’m studying Japanese this semester.

/// or “I’m studying Japanese this semester.”

<br>

#### Use of the conjunctive form 3

/// The conjunctive form can be combined with ください to express a polite command and request.

<br>

明日の朝、九時にここに来てください。//Please come here at 9:00 tomorrow morning.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Stems

/// Stems are used with many different words, particles, or suffixes to express various things.

<br>

/// to derive the stem of a verb from its base form:

/// Group 1: Drop る from the base form.

/// Group 2: Change the vowel of the last syllable, {u}, to the vowel {i}.

/// Group 3: Drop る and change the vowel {u} of the remaining syllable to the vowel {i}.

///          [する → し], [くる → き]

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: たべる → たべ

/// G2: かく → かき

/// G3: する → し, くる → き

<br>

#### Use of the stem 1

/// -> [stem + ます]

/// The polite form of a verb is created by combining the stem and the suffix ~ます.

<br>

#### Use of the stem 2

/// -> [stem + たい]

/// When the stem is joined with the suffix ~たい, the combined form is an adjective that expresses the speaker’s desire.

/// Like the complex predicate with つもりだ, the newly formed adjective can be used only to express the speaker’s own desire or to ask another person directly about their desire.

/// It may not be used to express a third-person’s desire.

<br>

明日、どこに行きたいですか。町に行きたいですか。//Where do you want to go? Would you like to go to town?

町には行きたくありませんが、図書館に行きたいです。//I don’t want to go to town; I want to go to the library.

<br>

/// Since this form is an adjective, it follows the rules for conjugating adjectives:

/// the negative imperfective is 行きたくありません “I don’t want to go”;

/// the positive perfective is 行きたかったです “I wanted to go”;

/// and the negative perfective is 行きたくありませんでした “I did not want to go.”

<br>

#### Use of the stem 3

/// -> [stem + に]

/// The stem and the particle に can be combined to express the topic’s purpose for going somewhere to do something.

/// This construction is used as an adverbial phrase.

<br>

/// This structure may only be used if the final verb indicates direction (i.e. going, coming here, going home, etc.).

/// When the final verb is not a verb of movement, this construction may not be used.

<br>

私達はあの町に寿司を食べに行きました。//We went to that town to eat sushi.

新聞を読みに図書館に行きました。//I went to the library to read the newspaper.

<br>

## 5: Derived Verbs

### (1) About derived verbs

/// These derived verbs, which are further used as the base forms for aspectual conjugations, include potential, passive, and causative verbs.

/// they function as independent verbs.

<br>

### (2) Potential verbs

/// Verbs that express the ability of the topic to do something have been introduced as independent words up until this point.

/// These include 話せる {はなせる} “to be able to speak,” 書ける {かける} “to be able to write,” and 読める {よめる} “to be able to read.”

/// In addition to indicating ability, potential verbs also express possibility.

/// Their active counterparts are 話す {はなす} “to speak,” 書く {かく} “to write,” and 読む  {よむ} “to read.”

<br>

/// In English, a potential expression consists of the auxiliary verb “can” or “be able to” and a verb such as “speak,” as in “I can speak Japanese” or “I am able to speak Japanese.”

<br>

/// In Japanese, instead of being formed by adding an element to a verb, the potential verb (also called the potential form of a verb) is derived from the base verb.

/// The rules for forming potential verbs were not introduced along with the verbs above.

/// Of course, knowing how to derive potential verbs from the base forms is much more efficient than trying to learn them as separate verbs, so the rules are explained here.

<br>

#### Potential verb formation

/// Group 1: [る → られる]

/// Group 2: Change the final {u} to {e} and add る

/// Group 3: [くる → こられる]

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: たべる → たべられる

/// G2: かく → かける

<br>

/// There is no potential form for する; the corresponding verb that expresses ability and possibility is できる.

<br>

#### Verb grouping of potential verbs

/// All derived potential verbs conjugate as Group 1 verbs.

/// For instance, the conjunctive form is conjugated from potential verbs as follows: たべられる→たべられて, はなせる→はなせて, こられる→こられ て.

<br>

#### が or を as the direct object marker with potential verbs

/// The use of が as the object marker of a potential verb has already been pointed out.

<br>

パクさんは日本語が話せます。//Park-san can speak Japanese.

<br>

/// All potential verbs derived from transitive verbs become semi-transitive, because they have a non-action meaning.

/// Therefore, が is used to mark the direct object. In actual use, however, を may sometimes be used to mark the direct object rather than が.

/// This happens when the potential form is derived from a verb with a strong inherent transitive meaning, and thus を is almost considered an inseparable part of the verb.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Passive verbs

/// In English, a passive verb is constructed by combining an auxiliary verb such as “is” or “are” with a past participle such as “eaten” and “taken.” The thing or person who does the action is preceded by the preposition “by.”

/// In Japanese, passive meanings are expressed with derived passive verbs, just as potential meanings are expressed with derived potential verbs.

<br>

#### Passive verb formation

/// Group 1, 2: Change the final vowel u to the vowel a and add れる

/// Group 3: [する → される], [くる → こられる]

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: たべる → たべられる, みる → みられる

/// G2: かく → かかれる, かう → かわれる

<br>

/// Like derived potential forms, all derived passive forms are Group 1 verbs.

/// The following examples show how the conjunctive form is conjugated: たべられる → たべられて, かかれる → かかれて, こられる → こられて

<br>

/// In passive sentences, the agent (the person or thing doing the action) is marked by the particle に.

<br>

この大学では、日本語は多くの学生に勉強されている。//Japanese is studied by many students at this college.

この本は有名な人に書かれました。//This book was written by a famous person.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Causative verbs

/// Causation refers to a situation in which a person is caused to do something by another person or thing.

/// This may occur in a variety of circumstances where a person “forces/allows/lets/has someone do something.”

<br>

/// In English, causative sentences are constructed with such verbs as “make,” “let,” or “allow,” as in “I make my child drink milk every day.”

/// In this particular sentence, the sense of “making (someone) do (something)” is the causative element.

<br>

/// In Japanese, causative verbs may be used to express causation in certain circumstances.

/// There are also other constructions that also express “causation.”

<br>

#### Causative verb formation

/// Group 1: Change る to させる

/// Group 2: Change the final {u} to {a} and add せる

/// Group 3: [する → させる], [くる → こさせる]

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: たべる → たべさせる, おしえる → おしえさせる

/// G2: かく → かかせる, かう → かわせる

<br>

/// All derived causative verbs are Group 1 verbs.

/// The following examples show how they conjugate: たべさせる → たべさせて, かわせる → かわせて.

<br>

/// Causative sentences typically involve two people. The person who causes something is in the topic position.

/// The person who is caused to do something is marked by に

<br>

/// Causative verbs are often used when a person of greater authority makes another person with less authority do something.

<br>

#### Causative passive verbs

/// [Change the causative ending ~せる to ~せられる]

<br>

/// Because they are transitive, it is possible to make causative sentences into passive sentences — that is, causative-passive sentences.

/// For instance, the two causative sentences above may be expressed by causative-passive sentences.

/// Causative-passive sentences are used when the object in a causative sentence is in the topic position.

/// Because all causative verbs are Group 1 verbs, changing them into passive verbs is quite simple.
