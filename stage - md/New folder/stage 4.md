stage ４，１。

<br>

/// The following points should be understood:

/// 1. Long sentences are nothing more than combinations of smaller parts (words, phrases, clauses, and sentences).

/// The structures of long sentences may be either compound or complex.

/// In the case of long and complex sentences,

/// it is important to be able to figure out which clauses are dependent or independent and whether the dependent clauses are adjectival or adverbial.

<br>

/// 2. In discourse, topics and other elements are often deleted,

/// and it is important to be able to identify those deleted elements.

<br>

/// 3. Students who check the meaning of new words in a dictionary should keep in mind that the English meaning that is given for the word will not share the exact same properties of meaning as the Japanese word.

/// There is really no dictionary that can provide all the information needed for an accurate understanding of each word,

/// but students can ask their instructors questions that will help them to grasp the precise nuances.

<br>

/// 4. Just as Japanese and English words do not translate exactly, neither do grammatical structures.

/// Just because certain structures are used in English does not guarantee that the same structures are used in Japanese.

<br>

/// 5. The speaker’s point of view and/or interpretation are built into many Japanese sentences.

/// Students need to pay great attention to the use of complex predicates to add these nuances of the speaker’s view.

<br>

/// 6. Do not get discouraged if words or kanji learned earlier prove difficult to remember.

/// The most frequently used words and kanji will stay in one’s memory longer, but once learned, they will come back if used again.

/// They will be easier to remember if the student has seen them even once; twice is better than once, three times is better than twice, and so on.

/// Students should not feel frustrated when they forget what they have learned.

/// Frustration is a great hindrance to learning.

<br>



# Stage 4-1 Adverbial Clauses

<br>

## 1: Adverbial Clauses with 限り

/// 限り {かぎり} used in adverbial clauses comes from the verb 限る {かぎる}, which means “to limit.”

/// The verb preceding かぎり in adverbial clauses should be in the imperfective form.

/// An adverbial clause with かぎり expresses a condition limited to what is expressed in that clause.

<br>

あなたがここにいるかぎり、私は勉強できません。//As long as you are here, I cannot study.

あなたが僕に英語を話すかぎり、僕の日本語は上手にならないと思います。//So long as you speak English to me, I believe that my Japanese will not improve.

あなたは、お酒をやめないかぎり、元気になりませんよ。//You will not be healthy, as long as you do not quit drinking.

<br>

#### ~にかぎって

/// The adverbial phrase ~にかぎって also derives from the verb 限る.

/// The statement made in the main clause applies only to the person or a thing expressed in ~にかぎって.

<br>

田中さんにかぎって、そんなことを言うはずがない。//There is no way that Tanaka-san would say such a thing.

<br>

## 2: Adverbial Clauses with 結果

/// 結果 {けっか}, used as a noun in this structure, means “result.”

<br>

先週、試験を受けましたが、その結果はまだ分かりません。//I took the examination last week, but I don’t know its result yet.

<br>

/// 結果 can also be used as a sentential conjunction.

<br>

一生懸命に勉強しました。その結果、試験に合格しました。//I studied hard. As a result, I passed the exam.

<br>

/// 結果 may also be used in adverbial clauses.

/// The meaning of the adverbial clause with this 結果 is the reason for the result expressed in the main clause.

<br>

毎日、五時間、練習した結果、今回は試合に勝つことができました。//I was able to win the competition this time as a result of having practiced five hours a day.

<br>

## 3: Adverbial Clauses with 頃

/// The word 頃, pronounced ごろ, has already been introduced in Stage 1–4 with specific times, as follows.

<br>

今は三時頃でしょうか。//Is it around 3:00 now?

<br>

/// 頃may be used as a time adverb, but in this case it is pronounced ころ and never ごろ.

/// ころ in this use is normally written in hiragana rather than kanji.

<br>

あなたは三年前、日本にいたのですか。私はそのころ中国で勉強していました。//So, you were in Japan three years ago? I was studying in China around that time.

<br>

<br>

あなたが日本に着いたころ、私はまだ寝ていました。//Around the time you arrived in Japan, I was still asleep.

私がドイツで勉強しているころは、あなたはもうそこにはいませんね。//Around the time I will be studying in Germany, you will no longer be there, will you?

<br>

## 4: Adverbial Clauses with 際

/// 際 {さい}, when used as a sentential conjunction, is very similar in meaning to 時 {とき}.

/// The use of 際 is, however, rather formal.

<br>

来年、日本にいらっしゃるんですか。その際には、是非、うちにもいらして下さい。//You will come to Japan next year? Do come visit us, if you come at that time.

<br>

/// When 際 is used in an adverbial clause, the clause expresses the time when the event described in the main clause has occurred or will occur.

/// The use of 際 here is also very similar to 時, but it is more formal.

<br>

日本にいらした際には、是非、お立ち寄りください。//When you come to Japan, please do visit us.

<br>

## 5: Adverbial Clauses with 次第

/// The adverbial clause with 次第 {しだい} expresses a time condition for an event referred to in the main clause.

/// The sentence with this adverbial clause explains that the event expressed in the main clause occurred or will occur as soon as the event described in the adjectival clause is complete.

/// The predicate of this adverbial clause must be formed by combining the stem of a verb and 次第 {しだい}.

<br>

朝ご飯が終わり次第、仕事に出かけます。//As soon as I finish my breakfast, I will leave for work.

<br>

/// Using the adverb すぐに “immediately” instead of the adverbial clause with 次第 conveys a similar meaning.

/// The adverb すぐに modifies the main clause,

/// and the adverbial clause may be expressed by such forms as the たら-form or て-form.

<br>

朝ご飯が終わったら、すぐに仕事に出かけます。//As soon as I finish my breakfast, I will leave for work.

朝ご飯が終わって、すぐに仕事に出かけます。//As soon as I finish my breakfast, I will leave for work.

<br>

/// There are differences between the two structures,

/// the one with the adverbial clause with 次第 and the other with the adverb すぐに.

/// One difference is the level of formality.

/// 次第 is used in more formal situations than すぐに.

/// Another difference is time.

/// The length of the interval between the end of the event expressed in the adverbial clause and the beginning of the event expressed in the main clause is shorter in sentences with 次第 than in those with すぐに.

<br>

#### Noun with 次第

/// In addition to its use in the adverbial clause, 次第 may be used to mean “something is up to/depends on the noun.”

<br>

いつ行きましょうか。//When shall we go?

あなた次第です。//It is up to you.

成功するかしないかは彼の能力次第です。//Whether we will succeed or not depends on his ability.

<br>

## 6: Adverbial Clauses with 瞬間

/// So, when an adverbial clause with 瞬間 is used in a sentence, the events described in the two clauses occur very close to each other.

<br>

## 7: Adverbial Clauses with ために

/// The first two uses of ために in the following were introduced in Stages 2–4 and 2–5, but the third structure is new.

<br>

#### Beneficiary phrase

/// ために used after a noun indicates that the preceding noun is the beneficiary of the event expressed in the sentence.

<br>

母のために、この手紙を書いています。//I am writing this letter for my mother.

子供のために、たくさんお金を貯めたいと思っています。//I want to save a lot of money for my children.

<br>

#### Purpose clause (imperfective predicates)

/// ために used in an adverbial clause expresses the purpose of the action expressed in the main clause.

/// In this case, the predicate in the adverbial clause is always in the imperfective.

<br>

来年、日本に行くために、今、日本語を勉強しています。//I am studying Japanese in order to go to Japan next year.

<br>

#### Causal clause (perfective predicates)

/// An adverbial clause with ために, when the predicate of that clause is in the perfective form,

/// is used to give a reason for the event expressed in the main clause.

/// The consequence stated in the main clause in this construction is usually not a positive one.

/// This differs from the other adverbial reason clauses (e.g., から, ので, ~て).

<br>

日本に三年間、住んでいたために、英語の話し方を少し忘れました。//Because I lived in Japan for three years, I forgot a little how to speak English.

あの人はいい教育を受けなかったために、いい仕事に就けなかった。//Because he did not receive good education, he was not able to get a good job.

<br>

## 8: Adverbial Clauses with 度に

/// An adverbial clause with 度に {たびに} indicates that every time the event described in that clause happens,

/// the result is the event described in the main clause.

<br>

私は車に乗るたびに、気分が悪くなる。//Every time I ride in a car, I feel sick.

試験を受けるたびに、勉強が嫌になる。//Every time I take a test, I feel discouraged about my studies.

<br>

/// Adverbial clauses with と express a similar meaning.

/// Recall that the adverbial clause with と expresses natural consequences in the main clause.

/// If a sentence with the adverbial clause with 度（たび）に is used to express a natural consequence, the sentence becomes quite awkward.

/// Compare the following two sentences:

<br>

春が来ると、暖かくなる。//When spring comes, it gets warm.

<br>

/// The above sentence with 度に is awkward because the event expressed in the main clause sounds as if the information is totally new to the listener or the reader of this sentence.

/// 度に, therefore, should be used when the consequence expressed in the main clause is a personal event or experience, as shown below.

<br>

春が来る度に、庭の花を植え替える。//Every spring, I plant new flowers in the garden.

<br>

## 9: Adverbial Clauses with 場合

/// 場合 {ばあい}, a noun meaning “occasion”; “case,” is used either as a sentential conjunction or in adverbial clauses.

<br>

薬は飲んでも効かないことがあります。そんな場合には、飲むのを止めてください。//Sometimes medicine does not work. When that happens, you should stop taking it.

<br>

#### In adverbial clauses

/// When 場合 is used in an adverbial clause, the clause with 場合 expresses a certain situation that becomes the condition for the occurrence of another event described in the main clause.

/// The following sentences may sound similar to the sentences with the adjectival clauses with 時,

/// but the clause with 時 specifies a time condition rather than a situation.

<br>

先生が来ない場合は、電話をしてください。//If the teacher does not show up, please call me.

授業を休んだ場合は、次の日に先生に言うことにしています。//I make it a rule to tell my teacher on the following day in the event that I did not go to class.

<br>

## 10: Adverbial clauses with やいなや

/// When やいなや is used in an adverbial clause, an event expressed in the main clause comes immediately after the event expressed in the adverbial clause is complete.

/// Use the imperfective form before やいなや.

<br>

家に帰るやいなや、友達から電話がありました。//As soon as I returned home, I had a phone call from a friend.

<br>

/// Adverbial clauses with やいなや are very similar in meaning to adverbial clauses with 瞬間に {しゅんかんに} and 次第 {しだい}.

/// The following summarizes the meaning and structural differences of the three:

<br>

#### Meaning differences

/// The adverbial clause with 次第に focuses on the completion of the event expressed in the adverbial clause.

/// The adverbial clauses with 瞬間に and やいなや, rather than focusing on the completion,

/// emphasize the short time between the two events described in the adverbial and main clauses.

/// The use of やいなや sounds more formal than the use of 瞬間に.

<br>

#### Predicate forms in the adverbial clauses

/// Pay special attention to the predicate forms when using 次第, 瞬間に, and やいなや in adverbial clauses.

/// Before やいなや, use the imperfective form; before 瞬間に, use the perfective; and before 次第に, use the stem form.stage ４，２。

# Stage 4-2 Adverbs and Adverbial Phrases

<br>

## 1: What Do Adverbs and Adverbial Phrases Do?

/// Adverbs are single words, but adverbial phrases and clauses consist of more than one word.

/// Adverbial phrases cannot stand alone, but adverbial clauses contain the same minimum elements as sentences.

/// Adverbs and adverbial phrases add a great deal of information to what the speaker or the writer wishes to convey.

<br>

/// For instance, to express different ways to “walk,” English speakers may use different verbs,

/// e.g., “stroll,” “trail,” “stride,” “hobble,” “waddle,” among others.

/// Japanese speakers tend to rely on a single verb 歩く, combined with various adverbs (including onomatopoeia) to express different ways of walking.

<br>

/// 歩く “walk”, ぶらぶら歩く “stroll”, 足をひきずって歩く “limp”,  大またに歩く “stride”,

/// びっこをひいて歩く “hobble”, よたよた歩く “waddle”, よちよち歩く “toddle” (e.g., infants)

<br>

/// There are obviously too many adverbs and adverbial phrases to list here,

/// so the list is limited to some common onomatopoeia and adverbial phrases, especially fixed phrases.

<br>

## 2: Onomatopoeia

/// The use of onomatopoeia enriches expressions, especially when speaking.

/// They are best learned with the appropriate verb, especially when they are used adverbially.

/// The list of onomatopoeia below therefore gives the verbs they are associated with.

<br>

/// ワンワン泣く cry (bawling), シクシク泣く cry (sobbing), エーンエーン泣く cry (baby),

/// ゲラゲラ笑う laugh aloud,

/// にっこり笑う smile (brief; fleeting), にこにこ笑う smile (beaming),

/// こっくりこっくり寝る sleep (nod or doze), ぐうぐう寝る sleep (soundly), ぐうすか寝る sleep (carefree; snoring),

/// がたがた震える tremble (large shakes), ぶるぶる震える tremble (shiver),

/// ジーっと見る stare (one place), じろじろ見る stare (eyes moving around),

/// ぶつぶつ文句を言う complain (by mumbling), くどくど文句を言う complain (naggingly; repeatedly),

/// びしょびしょに濡れる get wet (could be a part of the body), びっしょり濡れる get wet (the entire body),

/// じりじり暑い hot (scorching), ぽかぽか暖かい warmth (from sunshine),

/// 汗をたらたら流す sweat (dripping sweat), 汗がじっとり出る sweat (light sweat; no dripping)

<br>

## 3: Adverbial Phrases with ~ずに

/// The adverbial use of ~ないで was introduced in Stage 2–1,

/// and sentences with this expression mean that the action described in the main clause was or will be achieved without completing the action described in the adverbial phrase.

/// Equivalent to the ~ない negative, the ~ず negative is an older way to indicate the negative of verbs.

/// Adding the particle に, ~ずに sounds more formal than ~ないで in both writing and speech.

<br>

朝ご飯を食べないで（食べずに）、学校に行きました。//I went to school without eating breakfast.

両親に言わないで（言わずに）、大学院の入学試験を受けました。//I took an entrance examination for graduate school without telling my parents.

<br>

/// The ~ず negative forms of する and くる are せず and こず, respectively.

<br>

宿題をせずに、授業に行った。//I went to class without doing my homework.

お金を持ってこずに、買い物に行きました。//I went shopping, but didn’t take any money.

/// When used adverbially, the verb must be in the conjunctive form.

<br>

思い切って、日本に行くことにしました。//I wasn’t sure in the beginning, but I made up my mind to go to Japan.

してみないと結果は分かりませんから、思い切って、やってみて下さい。//Since you don’t know what will happen unless you try, you should just give it a try.

<br>

### (3) 思わず・・・~てしまう

/// たった is more colloquial than ただ, but it emphasizes aloneness or emptiness even more.

<br>

<br>

### (7) ひょっとすると

/// The fixed phrase ひょっとする may be used to express the following nuance: “possibly”; “by chance.”

<br>

### (10) ~ぶり

/// The Preparatory Stage introduced the expression ひさしぶりですねえ “We have not seen each other for quite a while, have we?”

/// The suffix ~ぶり indicates the time interval that has passed since the last event, so the element before ~ぶり should be time-related.

/// It is often used with the words that express duration.

<br>

三年ぶりに、山中さんに会った。//I saw Yamanaka-san for the first time in three years.

五日ぶりに、ご飯を食べた。//I had a meal for the first time in five days.stage ４，３。

# Stage 4-3 Complex Predicates

<br>

## 1: Complex Predicates with つもりだ

/// The complex predicate with つもりだ was introduced and discussed in Stages 1–7, 1–9, and 2–7.

/// These points are reviewed below, and some additional information is added.

<br>

#### When the predicate is in the imperfective

/// The speaker’s intention to do or not to do something is expressed by the positive and negative imperfective predicate preceding つもりだ, respectively.

<br>

私は来年、日本で勉強するつもりです。//I plan to study in Japan next year.

来年、日本で勉強しないつもりです。//I do not plan to study in Japan next year.

<br>

/// It may not be used to express a third-person’s plan, however.

<br>

卒業したら、どんなことをするつもりですか。//What are you planning to do after you graduate?

<br>

#### Denying intention or having no plan

/// There is a subtle meaning difference depending on whether the negation is placed in the predicate preceding つもりだ or in the main predicate.

<br>

/// When the predicate preceding つもりだ is negative, the sentence indicates that the speaker has no plan to do something.

/// For instance, when asked whether or not he/she plans to study in Japan, the following sentence may be used to respond negatively to that question.

<br>

来年は日本で勉強しないつもりです。//I do not plan to study in Japan next year.

<br>

/// The following sentence indicates that the speaker negates someone else’s assumption.

/// For example, when the addressee believes that the speaker will go to Japan next year,

/// the following response may be used to deny such an assumption.

<br>

来年、日本で勉強するつもりはありません。//I have no plan to study in Japan next year.

/// Literally, “The plan of studying in Japan does not exist.”

<br>

/// The above structure is not the negative construction of the complex predicate with つもりだ.

/// Rather, the functional noun つもり is modified by the adjectival clause, 日本で勉強する, and the verb ある in the negative form is used following it.

<br>

/// In fact, the negative structure of the complex predicate with つもりだ is not used to convey the above message.

<br>

#### Perfective copula

/// When the speaker had a plan or intention that did not materialize, the complex predicate with つもりだ with the perfective copula is used, as follows.

## 2: Complex Predicates with はずだ

/// The complex predicates with はずだwere introduced in Stage 2–7 to express the speaker’s expectation of others or events.

/// Below, after reviewing the structure in which the imperfective predicate is used preceding はずだ, some additional information is added.

<br>

#### When the predicate is in the imperfective

/// The complex predicate with はずだ expresses the speaker’s expectation of others, of events, or even of the speaker him/herself.

あの人からの手紙は今日は来ないはずです。//I don’t think the letter from him will arrive today.

<br>

#### Denying an expectation or having no expectation

/// Like the complex predicate with つもりだ, there is a subtle meaning difference depending on whether the negation is placed in the predicate preceding はずだ or in the main predicate.

<br>

/// First, when the predicate preceding はずだ is in negative, the sentence indicates that the speaker expects that the event will not occur.

/// For example, when asked whether or not the letter from a certain person will arrive today,

/// the following sentence may be used in the case that the speaker expects the letter will not arrive today.

<br>

あの人からの手紙は今日、来ないはずです。//I don’t think that the letter from him will arrive today.

/// When the speaker wants to say that an expected event did not materialize,

/// the copula of the complex predicate with はずだ must be in the perfective form.

<br>

/// This construction conveys the following meaning: the topic of the sentence has a strong urge to do something.

<br>

/// The negative suffix ~ず is an old way of negating verbs (see Stage 4–2).

/// To obtain this ず-form, replace the modern negative ~ない with ~ず.

/// The only exception is the verb する, the old negative of which is せず rather than しず.

/// The には before いられない are the particles に and は.

<br>

/// When ~ない is used instead of ~ず, the conjunctive form of the copula, で, and the particle は must be used before いられない.

/// と is the quotative particle and は is contrastive.

/// The clause before と indicates a certain statement, and the speaker negates its validity.

/// This complex predicate should be considered a fixed expression.

<br>

<br>

/// A similar meaning may be expressed by the complex predicate with ところ, which was introduced in Stage 3–3.

<br>

<br>

/// Although these examples of the complex predicates with ~つつある and ところ indicate actions that are about to begin, the contexts are different.

<br>

/// The construction with ところ may be used for everyday actions such as studying, eating, etc.,

/// while that with ~つつある is for more serious or unusual events that are about to happen.

/// Another difference is that the action or event expressed with ~つつある suggests that the initial stage, but not the main event itself, might have already begun,

/// but the structure with ところ does not imply the same thing.

<br>

## 9: Complex Predicates with ~ ざるをえない

# Stage 4-4 Conjunctions

<br>

/// The mainly sentential conjunctions covered here are grouped according to function.

/// Some have already been introduced. Needless to say, there are many more, but the number of functions is more or less finite.

<br>

## 1: Adding Information

<br>

### (1) その上

/// 上 {うえ} means “above; over; top,” and the conjunction その上 is used to mean “moreover.”

/// The function of this conjunction is to add information beyond what has been given in the previous sentence.

<br>

あの人は何でもできる天才のようだ。その上、性格も素晴らしいと言われている。//She seems to be a genius who can do anything. On top of that, I hear that she is a wonderful person.

<br>

### (2) しかも

/// The conjunction しかも is similar to その上.

/// Derived from the overriding particles, しか and も, しかも forms a sentential conjunction that adds the information in the first sentence onto that of the second sentence.

/// The two sentences joined by しかも mean something like “not only (information given in the first sentence), but also (information given in the second sentence).”

<br>

あの男性は人の言うことなんか全く聞かない。しかも、口から出てくる言葉は文句ばかりだというから、始末に終えない。//That man does not listen to others. Not only that, all he does is complain, so he is very difficult to deal with.

<br>

/// The difference between その上 and しかも is the following.

/// When two sentences are joined by その上, the information given in the second sentence is a simple addition to the first.

/// When joined by しかも, the information given in the second sentence strengthens the statement made in the first sentence.

<br>

### (3) あるいは

/// あるいは indicates that the information given in the second sentence is alternative to the information given in the first sentence.

<br>

あんなに泣いているのは辛いからなのだろう。あるいは、嬉しいからなのだろうか。//Is she crying because she is in pain? Or is it because she is happy?

<br>

## 2: Consequences

<br>

### (1) したがって

/// The conjunction したがって derives from the verb 従（したが）う “to follow.”

/// It is used to link the preceding and following sentences into a cause-and-consequence relation.

<br>

この夏の雨量は最低である。したがって、市は水不足対策にとりかかっている。//Rainfall this summer was the lowest ever. The town, therefore, has begun to implement a water shortage strategy.

<br>

/// The function of したがって is the same as だから, but だから is less formal.

<br>

### (2) すると

/// As introduced in Stage 2–5, the clausal conjunction と signals that the event described in the first clause is soon followed by the event described in the second clause.

<br>

部屋に入ると、電話がなった。//As soon as I entered the room, the phone rang.

<br>

/// This same meaning carries over in usage of the sentential conjunction すると.

<br>

いつものように六時頃、部屋に入った。すると、急に電話がなり出した。//I went into the room around 6:00 as usual. Right then, the phone suddenly began ringing.

<br>

### (3) その結果

/// The noun 結果 {けっか} means “result.”

/// The conjunction その結果 therefore indicates that the second sentence is the result of the event described in the first sentence.

<br>

音楽コンクールに参加するために三年間、毎日、厳しい練習をさせられた。その結果、コンクールで優勝でした。//For three years I had to practice very hard for the music competition. As a result, I won the competition.

<br>

### (4) それで

/// それで is composed of the demonstrative pronoun それ and で, the conjunctive form of the copula.

/// それ refers to the content expressed in the first sentence.

/// で connects the consequence expressed in the second sentence to its reason in the first sentence.

/// それで together functions as a sentential conjunction.

<br>

この漢字が分からなかった。それで、先生に聞きに行った。//I couldn’t read this kanji at all. So, I went to the teacher for help.

<br>

/// The conjunction それで is similar to だから.

<br>

この漢字が分からなかった。だから、先生に聞きに行った。//I couldn’t read this kanji at all. Therefore, I went to the teacher for help.

<br>

/// The difference between それで and だから is the same as that between ~て and から when they are used to connect two clauses,

/// the first clause giving the reason and the second the consequence (see Stage 2–4).

/// Recall that the second clause, when joined by ~て, may not be such things as commands and suggestions.

/// This same restriction applies to the sentential conjunction それで.

<br>

これは壊れています。だから、使わないでください。//This is broken, so don’t use it.

<br>

## 3: Rephrasing

<br>

### (1) いわば

/// Literally meaning “in other words” or “one might say,” いわば is the old form of today’s 言えば {いえば}, the ば-form of the verb 言う.

/// いわば signals that the second sentence is a rephrasing of the first sentence.

<br>

私は父も母もいない者となってしまった。いわば、孤児である。//I became a person with neither father nor mother; in other words, an orphan.

<br>

### (2) すなわち

/// The rephrasing of a previously stated word, phrase, clause, or sentence is marked with the conjunction すなわち.

/// The rephrased sentence may contain the speaker’s conclusive statement.

<br>

南国の楽園、すなわち、ハワイに住めると健康が取戻せるかもしれない。//You might regain your health if you could live in a southern paradise — somewhere like Hawai‘i.

今日が僕の最後の日。すなわち、明日から僕の退職生活が始まるということになります。//Today is my last day. In other words, my retirement begins tomorrow.

<br>

### (3) つまり

/// Like すなわち above, つまり is used to rephrase a word, phrase, clause, or sentence in the following sentence.

/// Unlike すなわち, it does not convey a conclusive nuance, but rather another expression or interpretation of the event or idea.

<br>

私の妹、つまり、洋子はここには住んでいない。//My sister, that is, Yoko, does not live here.

私は試験に落ちた。つまり、来年は、日本に行けないということだ。//I didn’t pass the test. What that means is that I cannot go to Japan next year.

<br>

## 4: Contradiction

<br>

### (1) しかし

/// The conjunction しかし, like でも and けれども, is used by the speaker or writer to present a statement in the second sentence that is contradictory to the expectation that is likely to be inferred from the content of the first sentence.

<br>

彼は全力を尽くして頑張った。しかし、彼の努力は実らなかった。//He did his best, but his efforts were not rewarded.

<br>

/// In the above sentence しかし may be replaced by でも and けれども, and the sentence will have the same meaning.

/// The tone of しかし, however, is more formal.

<br>

### (2) しかしながら

/// しかし and しかしながら are similar in meaning and use. しかしながら carries an additional nuance, however.

/// It conveys the speaker’s or writer’s confirmation the value or truth of the content stated in the first sentence,

/// but it adds a statement in the second sentence, the content of which might contradict the inference of the first sentence.

<br>

勿論、勉強に力を入れるということはいいことだ。しかしながら、勉強し過ぎるというのもどうかと思う。//Of course, I realize it is good to study hard. However, it’s not a good idea to study too much.

<br>

### (3) ところが

/// The conjunction ところが connects two sentences in which the second sentence expresses an unexpected event or an event opposite to what is described in the first sentence.

<br>

主人がいないと思って友人と家に帰った。ところが、主人がもう家に帰っていて、本当にびっくりした。//I went home with my friend thinking that my husband was not there. However, I was surprised to find him home.

<br>

## 5: Clarification

<br>

### (1) だからといって

/// This conjunction marks a reference to the previous statement, indicating a clarification of its meaning in the second.

/// The predicate of the second sentence is often interpretative.

<br>

私は学生だ。だからといって、働かないわけにはいかない。//I may be a student, but that doesn’t mean that I can afford not to work.

私には英語が話せない。だからといって、アメリカには絶対に行かないというわけではない。//I cannot speak English, but that does not mean that I will never go to the United States.

<br>

### (2) ただし

/// When the conjunction ただし (“however; excepting that”) connects two sentences,

/// the second sentence expresses a condition that is needed if the first sentence’s statement is to be valid or true.

<br>

来週は旅行したいと思っている。ただし、社長が許可を出さない場合は駄目になるだろう。//I planned to go on a trip next week. If the president does not approve, however, I may not be able to go.

<br>

### (3) もっとも

/// When もっとも (“however; though”) is used to connect two sentences, the second sentence presents the possibility of additional interpretation or view.

<br>

彼は貴公子のような人だ。もっとも、私が勝手にそう思っている可能性は高いが。//He is like a prince. Of course, the chances are that I am the only one who thinks so.

<br>

/// もっとも and ただし are similar to one another,

/// but the second of the two sentences joined by ただし simply provides a condition,

/// while the second of those joined by もっとも adds another possible interpretation or view.

<br>

## 6: Stems and Adverbial Forms as Clausal Conjunctions

/// One of the functions of the て-form is to connect clauses.

/// Stems of verbs and the adverbial forms of adjectives also have this function, but only in formal writing and speech.

/// In the examples below, both the conjunctive forms (in parentheses) and the stems or the adverbial forms are given.

<br>

日本には山が多くあり（あって）、住める所が少ないと思われているようだ。//People seem to think that the space for dwelling is limited in Japan because there are many mountains.

あの車は小さく（小さくて）、とても便利だ。//That car is small and easy to drive.

日本は島国であり（で）、火山が多い。//Japan is an island country and has many volcanic mountains.

<br>

## 7: Criteria of Usage

/// The phrasal, clausal, and sentential conjunctions introduced here are close in meaning.

/// It is true that many of them are interchangeable, and the meaning will be conveyed no matter which one the speaker or writer chooses, as long as the connection is made correctly for the content.

/// Students of Japanese will naturally wonder which to choose in speaking and writing.

<br>

/// When trying to choose an appropriate conjunction, one criterion you should keep in mind is the formality of the speech or writing.

/// It is also good to avoid repetition.

/// Using different conjunctions between sentences in the same paragraph is more effective in speech and writing.

<br>

/// Subtle nuances are important in conveying messages.

/// As mentioned, many of the conjunctions discussed above, as well as others not listed here, are interchangeable, but carry subtle differences in meaning.

/// Understanding the nuances of these conjunctions will no doubt make speech and writing more effective and polished, but a great deal of time and effort will of course be required to attain such mastery.stage ４，５。

# Stage 4-6 Honorifics (Summary)

<br>

## 1: Honorifics and Politeness

/// The concepts of honorifics and politeness as well as some relevant words are introduced in Stages 1–5, 1–8, 2–6 and other parts of the course.

/// This chapter summarizes these concepts.

<br>

### (1) 待遇表現（たいぐうひょうげん）

<br>

#### 敬語（けいご）, 謙譲語（けんじょうご）, and 丁寧語（ていねいご）

/// 待遇表現（たいぐうひょうげん） is the umbrella term for a language system in which personal relations are reflected in language use.

/// Within this system, 敬語（けいご） is used by a speaker to show respect for the topic referred to,

/// and 謙譲語（けんじょうご） is used to refer to an action or state of the speaker himself or herself in a humble manner,

/// showing respect for the addressee.

<br>

/// As described in Stages 1–5, 1–8, and 2–6, politeness 丁寧語（ていねいご） and honorifics 敬語（けい ご） are related, but with the following distinction.

/// Politeness is determined by the relationship between the speaker and the addressee whereas honorifics address the relationship between the speaker and the topic.

<br>

### (2) Use of plain forms in honorific sentences

/// The use of the plain form indicates a close relationship between the speaker and addressee.

/// For example, the following sentence is used when speaking to a close friend or family member.

<br>

僕は家にいることにするよ。//I will stay at home.

<br>

/// In the sentence below, however, the verb is the honorific verb in the plain form.

/// The reason why the plain form of the verb is used is because the speaker is speaking to a close friend or family member.

/// The honorific verb is used because the verb refers to a topic, the teacher, toward whom the speaker shows his or her respect.

<br>

中村先生はまだ授業にいらっしゃるよ。//Nakamura-sensei is still in class.

<br>

/// The use of ~ます at the end of a verb indicates that the relationship between the speaker and addressee is not close.

<br>

私はもう少し家にいます。//I will stay at home a little longer.

中村先生はまだ授業にいらっしゃいます。//Nakamura-sensei is still in class.

<br>

/// The following shows the parts of a verb that reflect the relationship between the speaker and the addressee, and between the speaker and the topic.

<br>

/// いらっしゃ る いらっしゃい ます 

///    ↓       ↓     ↓        ↓

/// topic  addressee topic  addressee

<br>

#### Speech form used with family members

/// All family members are considered to be うち-group, so neither the polite form nor honorifics should be used when talking to them.

/// When talking about them, honorifics should not be used ( even when they are older than the speaker).

<br>

## 2: Honorific Verbs

<br>

### (1) The honorific いらっしゃる

/// Although this verb, いらっしゃる, is a Group 2 verb, the stem is いらっしゃい rather than いらっしゃり, which was the form used long ago.

/// The polite form therefore is いらっしゃいます rather than いらっし ゃります.

/// The verb いらっしゃる is the honorific form for いる, 行く, and 来る.

<br>

#### The verb いる

<br>

今日はうちにいることにします。//I decided to stay at home today.

中村先生はお宅にいらっしゃいます。//Nakamura-sensei is at home.

<br>

#### The humble おる

/// In a situation where the use of honorifics is preferred, when talking about the speaker herself or himself, the use of the humble form, 謙譲語（けんじょうご）, is most appropriate.

/// The topic of the humble forms must be the speaker or members of the うち group.

/// For instance, the humble form of the verb いる is おる（おります）.

/// By using the humble form, the speaker lowers himself or herself, which results in exalting the addressee.

<br>

/// 先生://Teacher:

「明日はどこにいますか。」//Where will you be tomorrow?

/// 学生://Student:

「私は明日ここにおります。」//I will be here tomorrow.

<br>

#### The verb 行く

<br>

/// （行く）

私は京都に行きます。//I will go to Kyoto.

<br>

/// （いらっしゃる）

先生はイギリスにいらっしゃいます。//The teacher will go to England.

<br>

/// The verb 来る {くる}

<br>

/// （来る）

メアリーさんは三時頃、家に来ます。//Mary will come to my house around 3:00.

<br>

/// （いらっしゃる）

中川先生は夕方、学校にいらっしゃいます。//Nakagawa-sensei will come to school in the evening.

<br>

#### The humble まいる

/// まいる is the humble verb for 行く and 来る.

<br>

私は明日、韓国にまいります。//Tomorrow I will go to Korea.

私の姉もこちらにまいります。//My sister, too, will come here.

<br>

### (2) The verb 言う

/// For the verb 言う {いう}, おっしゃる is the honorific and おっしゃいます the polite form.

/// As in the case of the verb いらっしゃる, the stem is not おっしゃり, despite the fact that it is a Group 2 verb.

/// The stem is おっしゃい.

<br>

先生は漢字は大切だとおっしゃいました。//The teacher said that kanji are very important.

<br>

#### The humble 申す

/// Recall the following expression from the Preparatory Stage chapter. 申す {もうす} in this sentence is the humble form of 言う.

<br>

私は田中と申します。//My names is Tanaka.

/// Literally, “I am called Tanaka.”

<br>

私は明日、行くと先生に申しました。//I told the teacher that I would go tomorrow.

<br>

## 3: Honorifics of Other Classes of Words

<br>

### (1) The copula でいらっしゃる

/// The honorific form of the copula also includes いらっしゃる, but in this case で must precede いらっし ゃる.

<br>

森先生でいらっしゃいますか。//Are you Mori-sensei?

<br>

#### The humble copula でござる

/// The humble form of the copula is でござる. Like いらっしゃる and おっしゃる, the polite form of ござる is ございます rather than ござります.

/// There are, in fact, just five verbs, all in the honorific system, that, like these three verbs, use い rather than り for the polite form.

<br>

私は森でございます。//I am Mori.

<br>

### (2) Honorific nouns

<br>

#### Use of polite prefixes

/// The prefixes of お or ご are added to nouns when the situation requires the speaker to use polite or honorific language.

/// The use of these prefixes, as well as knowing which prefix to use, is complex.

/// The use of お, the polite prefix, is much more prevalent among female speakers,

/// while the use of ご, the honorific prefix, may be used by both male and female speakers.

<br>

/// It is sometimes said that お is used with 大和言葉 {やまとことば} and ご with 漢語 {かんご}, but there are numerous exceptions.

<br>

/// prefix お: お花, お机, お勉強, お仕事

/// prefix ご: ご本, ご兄弟, ご両親, ご親切

<br>

/// In some words, the polite お and the honorific ご have become inseparable parts of the words.

/// Some examples are such words as お茶 {おちゃ} and ご飯 {ごはん}, which are used in both male and female speech.

<br>

#### Separate honorific nouns

/// Some nouns are reserved only for honorifics. お宅（たく） is the honorific word for the noun, 家 {うち}.

/// The second sentence below therefore not only possesses an honorific verb but expresses the place, the teacher’s home, in the honorific form as well.

/// This noun is used by both genders.

<br>

私はうちにいます。//I am at home.

先生はお宅にいらっしゃいます。//The teacher is at home.

<br>

### (3) Honorific pronouns

/// どちら is the honorific of どこ, both of which mean “where,” and どなた together with どちら is the honorific of だれ “who.”

<br>

スミスさんはどこにいますか。//Where is Mr. Smith?

スミス先生はどちらにいらっしゃいますか。//Where is Professor Smith?

<br>

だれがそこにいますか。//Who is there?

どなたがそこにいらっしゃいますか。//Who is there?

<br>

### (4) Honorific adjectives and adjectival nouns

/// As with nouns, the most common way to make adjectives and adjectival nouns into polite forms is to add the polite prefix お or ご.

<br>

お忙しいでしょう？//You must be busy.

先生のお嬢さんはおきれいですね。//Your daughter is very pretty, Professor.

ご親切、感謝します。//I appreciate your kindness.

<br>

/// When describing things, even if they belong to people that the speaker pays respect to,

/// the honorific prefixes お and ご are not used with adjectives and adjectival nouns.

/// For example, it is very strange to describe someone’s bag with an honorific adjective.

<br>

/// If the topic is a person, however, an honorific adjective may be used.

<br>

先生のお子さんはまだお小さいですねえ。//Your child is still very young, isn’t she, sensei?

<br>

#### Humble adjectives

/// Humble adjectives are used only on very formal occasions, and mostly by female speakers.

<br>

/// When the vowel before い is either a or o, change it to long o, and then add ございます, as in the following.

<br>

この靴は私には小そうございます。//These shoes are (too) small for me.

私の着物は青うございます。//My kimono is blue.

<br>

/// When the vowel before い is a u, make it into long u, and then add ございます.

<br>

寒うございます。//I am cold.

<br>

/// When the vowel before い is an i, make it into a long palatalized syllable, and then add ございます.

<br>

忙しゅうございます。//I am busy.

この靴は私には大きゅうございます。//These shoes are (too) big for me.

<br>

## 4: Regular and Irregular Honorific and Humble Forms

<br>

### (1) Irregular forms

/// There are regular and irregular honorific and humble forms.

/// The irregular forms must be memorized (see the chart below).

/// For the regular ones, there are convenient formulas for their formation.

<br>

/// Meaning | Neutral | Honorific | Humble |

/// to be | いる | いらっしゃる（*） | おる |

/// to go | いく | いらっしゃる | まいる |

/// to come | くる | いらっしゃる | まいる |

/// copula | だ | でいらっしゃる | でござる（*） |

/// to be; to possess | ある | おありになる | ござる（*） |

/// to say | いう | おっしゃる（*） | もうす・もうしあげる |

/// to eat; to drink | たべる・のむ | めしあがる | いただく |

/// to see | みる | ごらんになる | はいけんする |

/// to know | しる | ごぞんじだ | ぞんじる |

/// to do | する | なさる（*） | いたす |

<br>

### (*) As in the case of いらっしゃる, おっしゃる, and くださる, the ~ますforms of these verbs are the following: ござる→ございます, なさる→なさいます

<br>

### (2) Regular forms

/// Formula (honorific form) -> お（stem）になる

/// Formula (humble form) -> お（stem）する・いたす

<br>

/// Even when there is an irregular honorific verb, the honorific derived by the above formula may be used.

/// For instance, compare the following:

<br>

田中先生はお昼ご飯をたくさんお食べになりました。//Tanaka-sensei ate a big lunch.

田中先生はお昼ご飯をたくさん召し上がりました。//Tanaka-sensei ate a big lunch.

田中先生はお昼ご飯をたくさんお召し上がりになりました。//Tanaka-sensei ate a big lunch.

<br>

/// Japanese has different degrees of honorifics and quite a few ways to express courtesy and respect.

/// For instance, the verb of the last of the above examples is the most honorific of the three.

/// There are others in addition to those listed above, but not all possible options are presented in this course.

<br>

### (3) Stems of the five honorific verbs

/// The stems of the following five honorific verbs are irregular, as summarized below.

<br>

/// いらっしゃる → いらっしゃい → いらっしゃいます

/// おっしゃる → おっしゃい → おっしゃいます

/// くださる → ください → くださいます

/// なさる → なさい → なさいます

/// ござる → ござい → ございます

<br>

### (4) Regular and irregular humble forms

/// Regular humble forms are more complicated to use than irregular forms.

/// Irregular humble forms may be used just about anytime desired to speak politely.

/// This is not true with the regular humble forms.

<br>

/// The regular humble forms may not be used merely to sound polite when describing what one is doing.

/// They are used only when the speaker does something for someone else.

/// Compare the following two sentences, both of which intend to express that the speaker is reading as her or his own task.

<br>

今、本を読んでおります。//I am reading.

<br>

/// The irregular おります is used in the first sentence, but the regular humble form is used in the second sentence.

/// The reason why the second sentence is not acceptable is because the sentence sounds as if the speaker is reading for someone else.

<br>

/// When offering to do something for someone, one may use the regular humble form because the action is beneficial to the addressee.

<br>

お読みしましょうか。//Shall I read this for you?

<br>

## 5: Passive Forms as Honorific Forms

/// All passive forms, when meaning permits, may also be used as honorific verbs.

/// Expressions formed by the passive forms of verbs are less honorific than such honorific verbs as いらっしゃる.

<br>

/// As in the case of passive and potential, there is normally no meaning confusion among passive, potential, and honorific sentences because of the structural differences of the three types of sentences.

<br>

中村先生はいつもここでコーヒーを飲まれます。//Nakamura-sensei always drinks coffee here.

スミス先生はもう帰られましたか。//Did Smith-sensei return home?

<br>

/// The potential and honorific readings can, however, in some cases be ambiguous if some parts of the sentences are deleted,

/// which often happens in conversation. See the following sentence:

<br>

明日また来られますか。//Are you able to come here again tomorrow?

/// [honorific] “Will you come here again tomorrow?” [potential] “Are you able to come here again tomorrow?”

<br>

#### Notes on the use of honorifics

/// Some use of honorific expressions is expected.

/// In some social settings, although the level of politeness used may be a personal choice, the use of honorifics is expected.

/// An example of such a social setting is a language used by a store clerk in a store.

<br>

/// The use of honorific expressions is a personal choice.

/// Although use of honorifics is preferred in some social settings, it is a personal choice what level of politeness or honorific language to use.

/// Some people use honorific and polite language more often than others, even when they are in identical situations.

<br>

/// Honorific forms are used as polite expressions.

/// Honorifics are often used simply to be polite, and the use has little to do with who the speaker and the addressee are, or who or what the topic is.

/// People from older generations and women tend to use this style more often than others.

<br>

## 6: Examples of Politeness and Honorifics

<br>

### (1) When the topics of a conversation are the speaker and addressee themselves

/// When considering the level of politeness and honorifics to use, the speaker must be aware of the following:

/// 1. the social status of the speaker and the addressee

/// 2. the relationship of the two. These factors are not absolute.

/// In some cases, more subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle factors may need to be considered.

/// Age, for example, is often an important factor.

<br>

#### Situation 1

/// social status – speaker and addressee roughly the same

/// relationship – speaker and addressee know each other but not very well

<br>

/// Speaker:

明日うちにいますか。//Will you be home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

ええ、いますよ。//Yes, I will.

<br>

/// In the above case, the use of ~ます indicates that the two people are not very close,

/// but the use of the verb いる indicates that there is very little difference in their social status,

/// or if there is, the difference is not significant to either the speaker or the addressee.

/// Perhaps the two people who are conversing in this dialogue are working in the same company,

/// but they are not particularly well acquainted.

<br>

/// Here, there is no hard-and-fast rule for the decision to use a certain speech style based on these factors.

/// Even if the objective factors are clear to the speaker and the addressee,

/// the speaker may decide to use a different speech style than the one expected.

/// Because of this, not every possible style the speaker may choose can be illustrated here.

<br>

#### Situation 2

/// social status – speaker and addressee roughly the same

/// relationship – speaker and addressee are close friends

<br>

/// Speaker:

明日うちにいる？//Will you be home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

うん、いるよ。//Yes, I will.

<br>

/// In this case, the plain form is used rather than the ~ます form.

/// The verb ending of the plain form indicates that the relationship between the speaker and the addressee is close.

/// Notice that even the word for “yes” うん is more casual. In other words, not only the verb is affected by the speech style.

/// Note that the same speech style as the one above is used in conversations between members of an immediate family.

/// Although there are certainly differences in social status (and age, of course), these factors need not be considered within one family.

<br>

#### Situation 3

/// social status – speaker (student), addressee (speaker’s teacher)

/// relationship – speaker and addressee have known each other for quite some time

<br>

/// Speaker:

明日お宅にいらっしゃいますか。//Will you be home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

ええ、いますよ。//Yes, I will.

/// or うん、いるよ。

<br>

/// In the student’s speech, the use of the honorific verb indicates that the speaker respects the addressee because of the higher social status the addressee holds.

/// In this speech, even the noun for the addressee’s house is in the honorific form, お宅 {おたく}, rather than 家 {うち}.

/// The verb ending, ~ます, indicates that the speaker maintains the distance that is expected between a student and a teacher despite the fact that they have known each other for quite some time.

<br>

/// The teacher cannot use the honorific verb here because he/she is speaking to his/her student about himself/herself.

/// Therefore, the verb, いる or います, is used.

/// The choice between the polite form and the plain form depends on the teacher.

/// Women in Japan generally tend to speak more politely than men, and it is therefore quite possible to find a female teacher using います and a male teacher using いる.

/// It is not strange to see a teacher using the ~ます form with a student.

/// A male teacher, on the other hand, may choose to speak more casually even to a student.

<br>

/// The following examples of relationships between the speaker and the addressee are equivalent to the one given above:

<br>

/// 1. speaker (student), addressee (the speaker’s friend’s parent(s))

/// 2. speaker (company employee), addressee (speaker’s boss, or anyone of a higher rank)

/// 3. speaker (store clerk), addressee (customer)

<br>

/// The last case is interesting.

/// The speaker (store clerk) will always use the honorific verb in the polite form when speaking to the addressee (even if the clerk is older or in a higher social rank).

/// It is a social convention in Japan for store clerks to show respect for their customers, regardless of their social status and age.

<br>

/// Situation 4

/// social status – speaker (teacher), addressee (student)

/// relationship – speaker and addressee have known each other for quite some time

<br>

/// Speaker:

明日、うちにいますか。//Will you be home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

ええ、おります。//Yes, I will.

<br>

/// The humble form is used when talking about oneself in the presence of a respected addressee.

<br>

### (2) When the topic is a third party not present in the conversation

<br>

#### Situation 1

/// social status – speaker (student), addressee (student), topic (student)

/// relationship – speaker, addressee and topic do not know each other very well

<br>

/// Speaker:

田中さんは明日うちにいますか。//Will Tanaka-san be home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

ええ、いますよ。//Yes, he will.

<br>

/// Situation 2

/// social status – speaker (student), addressee (student), topic (student)

/// relationship – speaker, addressee, and topic are close friends

<br>

/// Speaker:

田中さんは明日うちにいる？//Will Tanaka-san be home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

うん、いるよ。//Yes, he will.

<br>

/// Situation 3

/// social status – speaker (student), addressee (student), topic (teacher)

/// relationship – speaker and addressee are not very close

<br>

/// Speaker:

田中先生は明日お宅にいらっしゃいますか。//Will Tanaka-sensei be at home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

ええ、いらっしゃいますよ。//Yes, he will be.

<br>

/// Since both students are talking about the teacher, both use the honorific verb.

/// The polite form is used because the speaker and the addressee are not close.

<br>

/// Situation 4

/// social status – speaker (student), addressee (student), topic (teacher)

/// relationship – speaker and addressee know each other quite well

<br>

/// Speaker:

田中先生は明日お宅にいらっしゃる？//Will Tanaka-sensei be at home tomorrow?

/// Addressee:

うん、いらっしゃるよ。//Yes, he will be.

<br>

/// In the above conversation, both the speaker and the addressee use the honorific verb because both are talking about their teacher.

/// However, they use the plain form because the speaker and the addressee know each other quite well.

<br>

/// Situation 5

/// social status – speaker (teacher), addressee (student), topic (addressee’s mother)

/// relationship – there is social distance between speaker and addressee

<br>

/// Speaker:

お母さんは明日うちにいますか。//Will your mother be at home tomorrow?

/// or お母さんは明日お宅にいらっしゃいますか。

<br>

/// Addressee:

はい、おります。//Yes, she will be.

<br>

/// The teacher can use either neutral polite or honorific polite speech. The choice is entirely up to him or her.

/// It is important to notice that the student uses the humble verb despite the fact that he/she is not talking about himself/herself.

/// Since the speaker refers to his/her own mother, the verb form is humble in the presence of someone the speaker respects.stage ４，７。

# Stage 4-7 Media Print Language

<br>

## 1: Headlines

/// Newspapers and magazines exhibit different kinds of writing.

/// Without attempting to cover all of them, this chapter addresses only some examples of language used for reporting in media materials.

<br>

/// Headlines of newspapers, magazines, or advertisements aim for efficiency of communication.

/// They are intended for maximum communication using minimal words.

/// This is often achieved by including only the essential words. Deletion, therefore, is widely used in headlines.

<br>

/// Deletion is not random, but follows certain rules.

/// Conventional ways of deleting elements in media language will include the following:

<br>

### (1) Copula omission

/// Headlines tend to end with nominal elements.

/// For sentences with nominal predicates, the copula is deleted.

<br>

投票日は７月２９日。//Voting day is July the 29th .

先ず、運動が大切。//Above all, exercise is important.

<br>

### (2) Deletion of する

/// The nominal ending of some verbal predicates is achieved by deleting する from verbs consisting of kanji or katakana.

<br>

大統領が来日。//The President came to Japan.

首相が渡米。//The Prime Minister went to the United States.

一分で３００枚コピー。//You can copy 300 pages per minute.

<br>

### (3) Use of nominal forms

/// Other nominal forms may also be used.

/// In the following, なし is a nominal form of ない.

<br>

今年は全員、ボーナスなし。//This year it’s no bonus for anyone.

<br>

/// The stem may also be used:

<br>

初めての試み。//Their first attempt.

<br>

### (4) Deletion of an entire predicate

/// The entire predicate may be deleted when it is obvious to the reader.

/// This occurs often in headlines.

/// In some cases, particles or conjunctions may be left in the text because they suggest the deleted predicate.

<br>

首相カナダへ。//The Prime Minister leaves for Canada.

コンピュータなら、これ。//For computers, this is the best.

<br>

### (5) Particle deletion

/// When the relation between words is clear from the context, particles may be omitted.

<br>

田中、三勝目。//Tanaka’s third win.

<br>

## 2: Main Text

/// The main text of newspapers and magazines is often written in the formal style.

/// Here are some of the factors that contribute to formality in writing.

<br>

### (1) である as the copula

/// である is used as the copula in formal writing.

/// The tone of である writing is strong and assertive.

<br>

東京はアジアの窓である。//Tokyo is a window on Asia.

<br>

/// の must be inserted between adjectival and verbal predicates and である.

<br>

日本の春は桜が実に美しいのである。//Cherry blossoms are truly beautiful in spring in Japan.

夏になると、日本はとても蒸し暑くなるのである。//When the summer comes, it becomes very muggy in Japan.

<br>

/// As seen above, である may be placed immediately after a noun, but の may be added for a stronger assertion of the writer.

<br>

戦争の犠牲者は市民なのである。//Civilians are the victims in war.

<br>

#### である between nouns

/// The assertive tone explained above is absent when である is used between two nouns,

/// the first one modifying the second, which is the same function as の.

/// The use of のである is more formal than の.

<br>

/// 聖者であるマザー･テレサ Mother Teresa, the Saint

/// 日本の名門校であるXX大学 Japan’s prestigious X University

<br>

### (2) The use of 漢語

/// 漢語 {かんご} are used much more often in the media.

/// For example, in newspaper headlines, 来日 {らいにち} and 渡米 {とべい} are more likely to be seen than their equivalent phrases.

<br>

/// 日本に来る → 来日 “come to Japan”

/// 亜米利加（アメリカ）に渡る → 渡米 “go over to the United States”

<br>

### (3) Long adjectival clauses in the topic position

/// Topics of newspaper sentences often have long adjectival clauses modifying them.

<br>

/// [夫人と共に昨夜、遅く日本に到着した] 米国大統領は・・・ “The American president, who arrived in Japan late last night with his wife . . .”

<br>

/// In the above phrase, the topic 米国大統領 {べいこくだいとうりょう} “the U.S. President” is modified by everything that precedes it.stage ４，８。

# Stage 4-8 On Words and Vocabulary

<br>

## 1: Complex Words

/// One way to join words is to join the stem of a predicate and another element,

/// and several examples of these complex words have been introduced in Stage 2–6.

/// This section lists a few more.

<br>

### (1) ~がい

/// A verb stem with がい refers to an “[action] worth doing.”

<br>

生きがいのある仕事を持てることはとても幸せなことです。//Anyone who has a job that he finds fulfilling is lucky indeed.

/// or she

<br>

/// As introduced in Stage 2–4, both やる and する mean “to do.”

/// やる is used in casual conversation.

/// In complex words with ~がい, however, やる rather than する is normally used.

<br>

この仕事は本当にやりがいがある。//This is a job that is really worth doing.

<br>

### (2) ~がち

/// The suffix ~がち comes from the verb 勝つ {かつ} “to win.”

/// The complex words with this suffix have the meaning of “tendency to (verb).”

<br>

あの人はどちらかというと憂鬱になりがちです。//That person tends to get depressed.

<br>

### (3) Combinations of more than two elements

/// An almost infinite number of meanings can be expressed by combining two words, with the first word in the stem form.

<br>

/// 寒過ぎる “too cold”

/// 書きやすい “easy to write”

/// 書きやすい “easy to write”

/// 払い忘れる “forget to pay”

/// 待ち疲れる “tired of waiting”

/// 雨が降り止む “stop raining”

<br>

/// More than two elements can be combined.

/// For example, the combination 読みやすそう consists of the verb 読む, the adjective やすい, and the adjectival noun そう, and means the following.

<br>

この本は読みやすそうですね。//This book looks easy to read.

これは食べにくそうですね。//This looks hard to eat.

雨が降り出しそうですね。//It seems as if it is about to rain.

<br>

## 2: Derived Words

/// Words in one category can sometimes be converted into another in a predictable manner.

/// Some examples are given below.

<br>

### (1) ~さ

/// Descriptive words, which are mostly adjectives and adjectival nouns (and a few nouns such as color terms),

/// can express the degree of description by adding the suffix ~さ.

/// As for adjectives, drop the final い and add さ, and for nouns and adjectival nouns, add さ to the original word.

<br>

/// 高い -> 高さ height

/// 重い -> 重さ weight

/// いい -> よさ goodness

/// 静か -> 静かさ（静けさ）* quietness

/// 便利 -> 便利さ convenience

/// 白 -> 白さ whiteness

<br>

/// * Both 静（しず）かさ and 静（しず）けさ are acceptable, but the latter is more common.

<br>

この国の値段の高さには本当に参ってしまった。//I am quite discouraged by the high price of things in this country.

ここの静けさが気に入っている。//I am fond of the serenity of this place.

<br>

### (2) ~的

/// Some nouns may be changed into adjectival nouns by adding the suffix ~的 {てき}.

/// For example, when ~的 {てき} is added to 日本 as in 日本的 {にほんてき},

/// this derived adjectival noun indicates that the thing or the person that the speaker describes has “defining characteristics of things or persons in Japan.”

<br>

あの女性は本当に日本的ですねえ。//That woman is very Japanese, isn’t she?

あの中国的な建物は何ですか。//What is that Chinese-looking building?

<br>

### (3) ~ぽい

/// When the suffix ~ぽい is added to a noun (the /p/ of ぽい is often doubled),

/// the derived adjective is used to describe something or someone having pronounced attributes of the noun used with ~ぽい.

/// For example, 子供っぽい {こどもっぽい} indicates that someone is “childish.”

/// The derived meaning is not necessarily negative, but it is often used in a negative way.

/// The derived adjectives are colloquial.

<br>

あの男性はいつまでも子供っぽいですねえ。//That man acts forever the child, doesn’t he?

<br>

### (4) 真~

/// The prefix 真~ {ま~}, when added to some descriptive words, indicates an extreme degree.

/// The consonant immediately after 真~ is usually doubled, and may be written with the small つ between the two kanji, as seen below.

/// For the noun 赤 {あか}, the first vowel あ disappears and the consonant /k/ of か is doubled.

/// For the noun 青 {あお}, the consonant /s/, doubled, is inserted between 真 and 青.

<br>

/// 赤 -> 真っ赤・真赤 bright red

/// 青 -> 真っ青・真青 deep blue

/// 白 -> 真っ白･真白 pure white

/// 黒 -> 真っ黒・真黒 pitch black

/// 中 -> 真ん中・真中 dead center

/// 正面 -> 真正面* directly in front

/// 先 -> 真っ先・真先 immediately; right away

/// 夏 -> 真夏 midsummer

/// 冬 -> 真冬 midwinter

<br>

/// * Also ましょうめん without doubling the consonant /sy(sh)/.

<br>

/// For color terms, when 真~ is added, the word category changes from a noun （赤 {あか} is a noun） to an adjectival noun, 真っ赤 {まっか}.

<br>

あの赤のセーターはだれのですか。//Whose is that red sweater?

あの真っ赤なセーターはだれのですか。//Whose is that bright red sweater?

<br>

/// (5) Fixed derived words

/// As examples, the following two fixed expressions contain the old negative ず.

<br>

#### 食べずぎらい

/// ぎらい comes from 嫌い {きらい} “not fond of (something).”

/// This fixed phrase means one “does not like a certain food, even without trying it.”

<br>

あの子は食べずぎらいの食べ物がとても多いです。//That child dislikes many kinds of foods without ever trying them.

<br>

#### 見ず知らず {みずしらず}

/// This expression, combining 見ず {みず} “not to see” and 知らず “not to know,” is used to describe “a total stranger.”

<br>

見ず知らずの他人を頼ることもできませんから、外国で生活をするのは大変です。//I found it difficult to live abroad, because I do not want to rely on total strangers.

<br>

## 3: The Verb する

/// The verb する has been presented thus far as meaning “to do,” but it has many other functions.

/// One of them is to describe a person.

<br>

/// When describing current occupations, for example, する is used in the continuous aspect, している.

<br>

私の母は高校の先生をしています。//My mother works as a teacher.

私の姉は花屋をしています。//My sister has a flower shop.

<br>

/// Note that independent occupations are not expressed with している.

<br>

/// In this case, it should be expressed with the copula.

<br>

姉は作家です。//My sister is a writer.

<br>

### (2) Describing facial and bodily features

/// A very common mistake is to describe facial and bodily features using the verb ある.

<br>

/// This misuse of あります is influenced by the use of have in the English sentence, “that woman has long hair.”

/// Use either the verb する (in the form of している) or the topic-subject structure (see Stage 1–7).

<br>

あの女性は長い髪をしています。//That woman has long hair.

あの女性は髪が長いです。//That woman has long hair.

<br>

/// The difference between the two sentences above is not very great,

/// but the first sentence with している describes a temporary state while the second sentence with the topic-subject structure indicates a more permanent one.

/// For instance, the use of している is better when saying that someone’s face is red due to drinking,

/// because the use of the topic-subject structure sounds as if the topic always has a red face.

<br>

飲みすぎて、あの人は赤い顔をしています。//That person has a red face because he drank too much.

<br>

## 4: Negative ~ぬ

/// In some formal speech or writing, ~ぬ may be used in place of the negative ~ない, as, for example, in the following constructions.

<br>

これはだれにも話さぬように、お願いします。//I would like to ask that you not tell anyone about this.

間違いをくりかえさぬために、ここに書いておこう。//I will write it down so that I will not make a mistake.

<br>

/// This negative, like ~ず, is an old form.

/// The ぬ-negatives of the Group 3 verbs, する and くる, are せぬ and こぬ.

/// The ず-negative may be used with に to form an adverbial phrase but ~ぬmay not.

/// Likewise, the ぬ-negative may be used with a functional noun such as よう, but ~ず may not.

<br>

## 5: Kanji Compounds

<br>

### (1) 漢語

/// As explained in Stage 2–5, the use of 漢語 {かんご} rather than 大和言葉 {やまとことば} normally adds formality to speech and writings, although there are some exceptions.

/// For instance, the following two sentences have the same meaning, but the one with 大和言葉 sounds more casual than the one with 漢語.

<br>

私はあなたのことが全く分かりません。//I really don’t understand you at all.

私はあなたのことが全く理解できません。//I really don’t understand you at all.

<br>

#### 漢語 formation

/// The structure of 漢語 is often related to the equivalent phrases in Japanese.

<br>

/// “to read books” 本を読む →  “reading” 読書 {どくしょ}

<br>

/// 自分で習う 自習 self-learning

/// 山に登る 登山 mountain climbing

/// ご飯を炊く 炊飯 cook rice

/// 人を殺す 殺人 kill others

<br>

/// Such pairs cannot be found for every expression, but they are quite numerous.

<br>

#### 最~

/// Knowing the components of kanji compounds is quite useful.

/// For instance, when the kanji prefix 最~ {さい} is added to another kanji, the compound expresses the superlative.

<br>

/// 最高 さいこう highest; best 

/// 最低 さいてい lowest; worst

/// 最大 さいだい biggest

/// 最小 さいしょう smallest

<br>

#### 以~

/// The kanji prefix 以~ {い} marks a level for measurement.

/// The measure is specified by a specific number that is used before the kanji compound with this prefix.

<br>

/// 以上 いじょう more than

/// 以下 いか (fewer) than

/// 以前 いぜん before

/// 以後 いご after

/// 以内 いない within

/// 以外 いがい except

<br>

子供に学校には五百円以上お金を持たせないでください。//Please do not allow your child to bring more than 500 yen to school.

３０分以内にこちらに来てください。//Please come here within half an hour.

<br>

### (2) 四字熟語

/// Many kanji compounds are made up of four kanji, called 四字熟語 {よじじゅくご}.

/// Dictionaries that focus on the meanings and usages of these compounds are called 四字熟語辞典 {よじじゅくごじてん}.

<br>

/// 春夏秋冬 {しゅんかしゅうとう}

/// spring, summer, fall, winter

/// four seasons

<br>

/// 東西南北 {とうざいなんぼく}

/// east, west, south, north

/// in all directions

<br>

/// 喜怒哀楽 {きどあいらく}

/// happy, mad, sad, fun

/// the range of human feelings

<br>

/// 弱肉強食 {じゃくにくきょうしょく}

/// strong animals eat weak ones

/// the survival of the fittest

<br>

/// 以心伝心 {いしんでんしん}

/// communicating without words

/// non-verbal communication

<br>

/// 一石二鳥 {いっせきにちょう}

/// kill two birds with one stone

/// accomplish two things at once

<br>

/// 自画自賛 {じがじさん}

/// praise one’s own painting

/// self admiration

<br>

/// 自業自得 {じごうじとく}

/// one receives punishment for one’s own deeds

/// consequence of one’s own action

<br>

## 6: Rules for Transitive-Intransitive Verb Pairs

/// Several transitive-intransitive pairs of words have been introduced, one of which is given as an example below,
