# Stage 2-5 Stems and Their Uses

## 1: Nominal Elements of Stems

### (1) About stems

#### Stem formation

/// To review the rules for deriving stems from base forms, see Stage 1–9.

<br>

#### The polite form as an example

/// See Stage 1–9 for information on the formation of polite forms with stems.

<br>

### (2) Stems as nouns

/// When used alone, a stem may function as a noun, although not all stems can be used as nouns.

/// The following examples are typical:

/// Base form: 話す Stem: 話 {はなし} Meaning as a noun: story; talk

/// Base form: 休む Stem: 休み {やすみ} Meaning as a noun: vacation; time off

/// Base form: 読む Stem: 読み {よみ} Meaning as a noun: reading

<br>

あの先生の話はいつも面白いです。//That teacher’s stories are always interesting.

明日、日本語の授業は休みです。//There will be no Japanese class tomorrow.

この漢字は音読みが二つと訓読みが一つあります。//This kanji has two on-readings and one kun-reading.

<br>

/// Please note that a stem used as a noun is different from a nominalized verb.

/// A nominalized verb with こと or の still maintains a verbal meaning, while a stem used as a noun does not.

/// Compare the following two sentences.

<br>

大学の夏休みは長いですねえ。//The college summer vacation is long, isn’t it?

忙しい時に、時々、休むことは大切です。//It’s important to rest sometimes when things are busy.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Stems used to describe the weather

/// Weather may be described by using nouns such as 雨 {あめ} and 雪 {ゆき}, as shown below:

<br>

今日は雨です。//It is rainy today.

明日は雪です。//It will snow tomorrow.

<br>

/// To describe clear and cloudy days, it is common to use the stems of the relevant verbs in the predicate position.

/// 晴れる {はれる} is a verb meaning “to clear up.” 晴れ {はれ} is the stem of this verb.

<br>

今日は晴れです。//It is sunny today.

<br>

/// Likewise, 曇る {くもる} is a verb that means “to become cloudy.” 曇り {くもり} is the stem of this verb.

<br>

今日は曇りです。//It is cloudy today.

<br>

/// The following formulaic expression is often used by weather forecasters, and may be heard in weather reports.

/// It is good to know this expression in order to understand TV or radio broadcasts, but there is no need to use it to describe the weather in conversation.

/// 後 {のち}, a rather formal word, means “later.”

<br>

今日は、晴れ、後、曇りです。//It will be clear at first and then cloud over later today.

<br>

/// In conversation, 後で {あとで} “at a later time,” with the optional で, may be used rather than 後 {のち}:

<br>

今日は、晴れで、その後（で）、曇りになると聞きました。//I heard that today will be clear at first, and then it will cloud over.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Responding to alternative questions with verbal predicates

/// There are three possible ways to respond to an alternative question:

/// 1. choose one of the options;

/// 2. choose both options;

/// 3. negate both options.

<br>

今日、勉強しましたか、（それとも）仕事しましたか。//Did you study or work today?

<br>

/// When choosing one of the options, state that option, as in the following:

<br>

仕事しました。//I worked.

<br>

/// When choosing both, use the following structure, in which the two nouns are used in the object positions:

<br>

勉強も仕事もしました。//I studied and worked.

<br>

/// If choosing neither option, use the following structure:

<br>

勉強も仕事もしませんでした。//I didn’t study or work.

<br>

/// The verbs in the above alternative question sentence contain the same verb する.

/// The following question sentence, however, contains two different verbs:

<br>

歩きましたか、走りましたか。//Did you walk or run?

<br>

/// In this case, to negate both alternatives, use the stems (which are nouns in form) marked by も with the negative form of the verb する.

<br>

歩きも走りもしませんでした。//I neither walked nor ran.

<br>

/// For choosing or negating both options, the pronoun どちらも “both” or “neither” may be used, regardless of the verbs used in the alternative question.

/// In this case, the verb する represents all verbs.

<br>

どちらもしませんでした。//I neither walked nor ran.

どちらもしました。//I did both.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Stems with に as Purpose Phrases

### (1) Purpose particle に

/// The particle に has many functions, as has already been shown.

/// In the following phrases, に functions to express the purpose of an action:

<br>

朝ご飯にりんごを食べます。//I eat apples for breakfast.

買い物に行きます。//I’m going shopping.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Purpose of going somewhere

/// the stem of a verb is used with the purpose particle に to express a certain action as a purpose.

/// In this construction, the last verb must be a directional verb that indicates a movement from one place to another, such as coming or going somewhere, or returning home.

<br>

映画を見に行きましょう。//Let’s go see a movie.

友達に会いにこのレストランに来ました。//I came to this restaurant to meet my friend.

お昼ご飯をたたべに家に帰りました。//I went home to eat lunch.

<br>

/// When the main verb is not a directional verb, a different construction must be used, as explained in the following section.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Purpose of doing something

/// When the main verb is one that does not indicate direction, such as “studying in order to become a teacher,” or “eating to gain weight,” then the purpose of the action should be expressed by the imperfective form of the verb followed by ために.

<br>

来年、留学するために、今年、日本語を勉強しています。//I am studying Japanese this year in order to study abroad next year.

友達と話すために、電話しました。//I called my friend on the phone in order to talk to him.

<br>

/// In fact, ために can be used for all verb types, even those that indicate direction.

<br>

すしを食べるために町に行きます。//I will go to town to eat sushi.

<br>

/// When both structures are possible, the purpose expressed by ために sounds more serious.

<br>

友達に話しに行きました。//I went to have a chat with my friend.

友達に話すために行きました。//I went to discuss something with my friend.

<br>

/// When the verb preceding ために is in the perfective form, the entire sentence takes on a different meaning.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) 大和言葉 {やまとことば} and 漢語 {かんご}

/// In addition to the use of a stem as a nominal form, one may see an actual noun that consists of kanji compounds in the same construction.

/// As explained thus far, both stems and nominalized verbs function as nominal elements.

/// In addition to these two kinds of nominal elements, there is another group of nouns that consist of more than one kanji.

/// These kanji compounds are called 漢語

<br>

/// For instance, the noun 読書 {どくしょ} “reading,” is a 漢語.

/// The same meaning can be expressed by the verb 読む with the nominalizer こと, as in 読むこと.

<br>

/// In the pair of sentences below, 食べ {たべ} is derived from the verb 食べる, while the noun 食事 {しょくじ} “meal” is expressed with two kanji.

/// This kanji compound is pronounced with the on-reading:

<br>

明日、一緒に食べに行きませんか。//Would you like to eat together tomorrow?

明日、一緒に食事に行きませんか。//Would you like to eat together tomorrow?

<br>

/// In any language, there is often more than one word to refer to the same thing, event, action, state, etc.

/// In English, these similar words, if not exactly the same, may have different origins: AngloSaxon and Latin/French-based, for example.

/// In Japanese, two common sources are native words and Chinese words.

/// The native words are referred to as 大和言葉 or 和語 {わご} while words of Chinese origin are 漢語.

/// For “reading,” 読む is 大和言葉 , while the kanji compound 読書 is of Chinese origin.

<br>

/// Not all 漢語 are of Chinese origin, however.

/// For instance, the verb 食べる is 大和言葉.

/// The 漢語 equivalent is 食事する, but this 漢語 is a Japan-made noun based on the structure of the words of Chinese origin.

/// There are quite a few such 漢語.

<br>

/// Notice the differences in the readings of the kanji of these two words.

/// For most 大和言葉, 訓読み {くんよみ} is used, as in 食べる.

/// And 音読み {おんよみ} is used for most 漢語 as in 食事.

<br>

/// The difference between the two kinds of words is often one of formality.

/// 大和言葉 are used more often in everyday speech, while 漢語 sound somewhat more formal.

/// Of course, this is just a broad generalization, and there are exceptions to this statement.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Emotive Expressions

### (1) Stem with たい

/// the construction of the stem with the suffix ~たい was introduced.

<br>

明日、映画に行きたいです。//I want to go to a movie tomorrow.

<br>

#### Expressing one’s own desires

/// In Japanese culture, it is considered overly direct to express one’s own desires, so it may not be appropriate to use the たい-form by itself in some cases.

/// To avoid such directness, many speakers add the verb 思う {おもう}.

<br>

来年、日本に行きたいと思っています。//I want to go to Japan next year.

<br>

/// Since the above sentence refers to the speaker’s current feeling, 思っている {おもっている} is better than the habitual 思う {おもう}, which is generally used to express the speaker’s opinions.

<br>

/// There is no need to add 思う when negating a desire or talking about a past desire.

<br>

そんな映画は見たくありません。//I don’t want to see that kind of a movie.

ミルクが飲みたかったです。//I wanted to drink milk.

<br>

#### Other facts

/// Other important facts to remember about this construction include the following

/// - The new forms are adjectives, as the last syllable い suggests;

/// - The object should be formally marked by the particle が, but in actual conversation を is also used;

/// - This expression can be used to express the speaker’s desire, or in a question addressing a second person directly, but it may not be used to talk about a third person’s desire.

<br>

#### A third person’s emotive expressions

/// As the last point in the above list states, certain emotive expressions may not be used to describe a third person’s emotive states.

<br>

/// There are many ways to talk about a third person’s desire.

/// One is for the speaker to report what the third person said regarding his or her feelings.

<br>

マイクさんは来年、日本に行きたいと言いました。//Mike-san said that he wanted to go to Japan next year.

<br>

/// Another way is for the speaker to express his or her inference based on direct observation by using a complex predicate with ようだ.

<br>

マイクさんは来年、日本に行きたいようです。//It seems to me that Mike wants to go to Japan next year.

<br>

/// Review and further study of structures with the verbs 言う {いう} (or おっしゃる) and 思う {おもう} follows below.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) The verbs 言う and おっしゃる

/// おっしゃる is the honorific verb of the verb 言う {いう}.

/// The polite form is おっしゃいます, rather than おっしゃります, just as the polite form of いらっしゃる is いらっしゃいます, not いらっしゃります.

<br>

/// Since おっしゃる is the honorific verb of 言う, it is used when the topic is someone to whom the speaker wishes to show respect.

<br>

/// With these verbs, there are essentially two ways to report what the other has said: the speech can be reported directly, or indirectly.

<br>

#### Direct quotation

/// In reporting speech directly, the speaker repeats exactly what another person has said.

/// In the direct quote, such things as the predicate style (polite vs. plain), the predicate ending, and sentence-final particles may also be reported directly.

/// When speaking, it is really up to the speaker to choose what to include in the quote.

/// When reporting in writing, use quotation marks.

/// In horizontal writing, 「 is used to open a quote, and 」 is used to close it.

/// The direction of the quotation marks changes when writing vertically.

<br>

伊藤さんは「このケーキはおいしいですよ。」と言いました。//Ito-san said, ‘You know, this cake is delicious.’

鈴木先生は「試験は金曜日です。」とおっしゃいました。//Suzuki-sensei said, ‘The examination will be on Friday.’

<br>

#### Indirect quotation

/// In an indirect quote, a speaker’s remarks are paraphrased rather than being quoted verbatim.

/// In this case, the content of the quote is expressed in the plain form, even though the person being quoted might have used the polite form.

/// Such things as sentence-final particles are not included in the indirect quote.

<br>

ジョンさんはこのケーキはおいしいと言いました。//John said that this cake was delicious.

<br>

/// With an adjectival predicate, as above, as well as with a verbal predicate, the copula is not needed for an indirect quote.

/// When the predicate is nominal, as below, the copula is needed to indicate aspect:

<br>

伊藤先生は試験は金曜日だとおっしゃいました。//Ito-sensei said that the examination would be on Friday.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) The verb 思う

/// Both 思う {おもう} and 考える {かんがえる} are translated as “to think.”

/// However, 思う, rather than 考える, is used for stating the speaker’s own opinions or thoughts.

/// 考える is usually reserved for the problem-solving type of thinking.

<br>

/// The verb 思う is used similarly to the verb 言う.

/// however, the verb 思う, is not used to quote thoughts directly.

/// Thoughts are generally conveyed by stating their content, rather than the verbatim thoughts themselves.

<br>

/// This verb can be used when the speaker asks the addressee what he or she thinks directly, or when the speaker expresses his or her thoughts.

/// Like other emotive expressions, this verb may not be used to express a third person’s thoughts.

<br>

/// When asking for opinions, use the interrogative pronoun どう rather than 何 {なん}.

<br>

あなたはこれについてどう思いますか。//What do you think of this?

とてもいい考えだと思います。//I think it’s a very good idea.

<br>

/// When asking for specific information, 何 {なん} or 何 {なん} with an appropriate suffix may be used.

/// In this case, the question particle か is not used within the embedded question (that is, the question clause used within the sentence).

/// In the sentence below, か should not be used between the clause 何人だ and the final verb 思う.

<br>

あの人は何人だと思いますか。//What nationality do you think that person is?

あの人は日本人だと思います。//I think he’s Japanese.

<br>

/// As mentioned above, the topic of the verb 思う is always the speaker in a statement sentence, or the addressee in a question sentence.

/// This verb may not be used to report a third person’s opinion. To do this, another element such as 言う {いう} or よう may be used after the verb 思う {おもう}, as shown below.

<br>

鈴木さんはそれはいい考えだと思うと言いました。//Suzuki-san said that he thought it was a good idea.

鈴木さんはそれはいい考えだと思っているようです。//It looks to me like Suzuki-san thinks it’s a good idea.

<br>

### (4) The verb 聞く

/// The verb 聞く {きく} has two different meanings.

<br>

#### 聞く “to hear”

/// It is most common to use indirect quotation to express something that has been heard from another person.

<br>

伊藤先生の授業はとても難しいと聞きました。//I heard that Ito-sensei’s class is very difficult.

伊藤先生の授業はとても難しいということを聞きました。//I heard that Ito-sensei’s class is very difficult.

<br>

/// To convey what has been heard directly, the two verbs, 言う and 聞く, must be used in a single sentence. This type of sentence will be covered in Stage 3–1, as the important factor of direct perception must be considered.

<br>

#### 聞く “to ask”

/// There are direct as well as indirect ways to report the content of a question.

/// When reporting directly, both か in the quoted question and と, which connects the quote and the verb 聞く, are used.

/// When reporting indirectly, the question particle かoverrides the quotative particle と.

<br>

鈴木先生は僕に「何時に起きましたか。」と聞きました。//Suzuki-sensei asked me, ‘What time did you get up?’

鈴木先生は僕に何時に起きたか聞きました。//Suzuki-sensei asked me what time I got up.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Two Simultaneous Events

### (1) Stem with ながら

/// The stem of an action verb with ながら is used as an adverbial phrase to express an action that accompanies a main action, but only as performed by a single person.

<br>

私はいつも新聞を読みながら、勉強します。//I always read the newspaper while I’m studying.

<br>

/// In the sentence above, the main action—studying—is described in the main clause.

/// The other action, reading the newspaper, is the accompanying action.

<br>

/// The main action in the English sentence can be expressed after the word “while” (as in the translated sentence above).

/// In Japanese, the function of the stem with ながら is adverbial, so it must be given before the thing it modifies (the main clause).

<br>

/// Aspects such as negation and time are all expressed in the main clause.

<br>

テレビを見ながら、勉強しないでください。//Please don’t watch TV while you study.

昨日、メールを読みながら、朝ご飯を食べました。//I read my e-mail while I ate breakfast yesterday.

<br>

/// The ながら-construction has the following restrictions:

/// - The ながら-construction may not be used to express an event in which two different people do two different things simultaneously (e.g., “I always read the newspaper while my mother watches TV”).

/// - Neither verb in the ながら-construction can be a stative (non-action) verb (e.g., “I got married while I was in Japan”).

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) The clausal conjunction あいだ（に）

/// Complex sentences joined by the conjunction あいだ（に） may be used in the two situations described above, where the construction with ながら is not possible.

/// The conjunction あいだ may be written in kanji as 間, or in hiragana; both are acceptable.

<br>

/// The construction with あいだ（に） may be used for the actions of a single person or those of two different people.

/// It may also be used to express simultaneous continuous actions, state events, or punctual actions.

/// The use of に is not optional. See the next section for the meaning differences between the sentences with and without に.

<br>

/// In the first example below, that the complex sentence joined by あいだ（に） is used to express events happening with two different people simultaneously.

/// The second example shows that the predicate within the adverbial clause may be stative.

/// It would not be possible to use ながら in either of these cases.

<br>

子供が寝ているあいだ（に）、私は勉強しました。//I studied during the time that my child was sleeping.

私は日本にいるあいだ（に）、漢字をたくさん勉強しました。//I studied a lot of kanji during the time I was in Japan.

<br>

#### The use of に after 間 {あいだ}

/// The particle に in あいだに is not optional.

/// When the particle に is used immediately after 間, it indicates that the duration of the events in the two clauses is not the same.

<br>

子供が寝ている間に、私は勉強しました。//I studied for part of the time that my child was sleeping.

<br>

/// When no に is used, it indicates that the duration of the events in the two clauses is the same.

<br>

子供が寝ている間、私は勉強しました。//I studied while my child was sleeping.

<br>

/// When the action within the main clause is punctual (non-continuous), に is obligatory.

<br>

私は日本にいる間に、彼に会いました。//I met him while I was in Japan.

<br>

#### Predicate forms in the あいだ-clause

/// Because predicate forms in the あいだ-clause are normally durational, the aspect of the adverbial clause does not have to be in the perfective form even for the past events.

<br>

私が病気の間、あの人は手伝ってくださいました。//That person helped me during the time I was sick.

部屋が静かな間に、勉強しました。//I studied while the room was quiet.

子供が寝ているあいだに、勉強しました。//I studied while my child was asleep.

<br>



ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Where does this bus go?

<br>

すみません。このバス、どこ行きですか。//Excuse me. Where does this bus go?

大阪行きです。//To Osaka.

京都行きはどこから出てますか。//Where does the bus to Kyoto leave from?

<br>

#### どこ行き

/// The stem of 行く is used to specify destination in a rather unusual structure.

/// When asking about a destination, it is used within the predicate in a complex noun, どこ行き, with no intervening particle.

/// The stem 行き may be pronounced either いき or ゆき; ゆき is very common in this context.

<br>

### (2) Expressing regret

<br>

ああ、どうしよう？やっぱり、試験、全然、だめだった！//What am I going to do? I knew this would happen . . . I totally messed up my exam!

僕も、あの試験、難しかったと思うよ。//I thought the exam was hard, too.

でも、昨日、私、音楽、聞きながら勉強してたから、私がいけないんだと思う。//But, it’s my fault . . . I listened to music the whole time I was studying yesterday.

<br>

#### どうしよう？

/// This is a casual version of どうしましょうか, “What should I do?” It is important to remember that ど う, rather than なん, is used for this expression.

<br>

#### やっぱり

/// This adverb is used when the speaker wants to express that the situation is what he or she has expected.

/// やっぱり is more casual than やはり.

<br>

#### 私がいけないんです

/// 私がいけない is an idiomatic expression that means “I am the one who should be blamed.”

/// ~んで す expresses that the speaker is trying to convince the addressee that it is his or her fault.

<br>

### (3) A great help

<br>

どうしよう？電車の時間に間に合わないと思います。//What shall I do? I don’t think I can make it to the train in time.

大丈夫ですよ。僕の車で駅まで行きましょう。//It’ll be fine. Let’s go to the station in my car.

ええ？いいんですか。ありがとうございます。本当に助かります。//Really? Are you sure? Thank you so much. What a great help!

<br>

/// 間に合わない is the negative form of the idiomatic phrase, 間に合う {まにあう} “to be on time.”

<br>

#### いいんですか

/// This expression is equivalent to an expression in English, “Are you sure that’s all right?” ~んです か indicates that the speaker wants to confirm his or her assumption or understanding.

<br>

#### 本当に助かります

/// 助かる {たすかる} is an intransitive verb indicating that “something is helpful to the situation that the person is in at the moment.”

/// When someone volunteers to help, this is an appropriate expression to use together with ありがとうございます in two separate sentences.
