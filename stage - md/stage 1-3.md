# Stage 1-1 Basic Structures of Japanese

<br>

## 1: Topic and Comment

### (1) Schematic composition of the basic sentence

/// sentence -> [TOPIC,COMMENT]

/// COMMENT -> [Subject,WHOLE PREDICATE]

/// WHOLE PREDICATE -> [Object,CORE PREDICATE]

/// CORE PREDICATE -> [Nominal predicate | Adjectival predicate | Verbal predicate]

<br>

/// The basic structure of a Japanese sentence consists of the topic and the comment, which serve as the foundation for longer and more complex sentences.

/// The topic is described in the comment; within the comment, the subject is described in the predicate.

<br>

### (2) Particles

/// are used after a noun or noun phrase, between nouns or noun phrases, or at the end of a sentence.

/// A noun is a word that refers to a person, a thing, a place, a concept, etc.;

/// a noun phrase is a noun with other modifying or added elements.

<br>

/// A particle essentially provides the preceding noun, noun phrase, or sentence with a function in the sentence.

<br>

/// There are three kinds of particles in Japanese: linking particles, sentence-final particles, overriding particles

/// linking particles, which link the preceding noun or noun phrase to the predicate or noun/noun phrase that follows it;

/// sentence-final particles, which are used at the end of sentences and indicate the speaker’s intent, view, interpretation, etc.;

/// overriding particles, which add further meaning to the existing particles.

<br>

#### The topic particle は (overriding particle)

/// whatever the speaker chooses to speak about or to pose a question about can be brought to the topic position in a sentence by marking it with the particle は.

/// the topic of a sentence in Japanese is made up of a noun or a noun phrase, and is indicated by the topic particle は.

<br>

#### Question particle か and confirmation particle ねえ (sentence-final particle)

/// か is used for question sentences while ねえ is used to confirm the speaker’s understanding or reaction with the addressee.

<br>

分かりますか。//Do you understand?

今日は暑いですねえ。//It’s hot today, isn’t it

<br>

#### Descriptive particle な (linking particle)

/// is used between two nouns.

<br>

今日はいやな天気ですねえ。//Terrible weather today, isn’t it?

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Predicates

### (1) The three types of predicate

/// The use of a subject and an object depends on the kind of predicate used in the sentence.

/// There are three possible predicate types in Japanese: the nominal predicate, the adjectival predicate, and the verbal predicate.

/// all predicates come at the end of the sentence

<br>

### (2) Nominal predicates - consists of a noun and the copula です.

<br>

私はずんだもんです。//I am Zundamon.

こちらはずんだもんさんです。//This is Zundamon-san.

<br>

#### The copula です

/// is similar to, but not the same as, the linking verb “be”

/// Another function of です is to indicate that the sentence is in the polite style.

<br>

### (3) Adjectival predicates - consists of an adjective and です.

/// Adjectives are a class of words that describe things, people, etc.

<br>

今日は寒いです。//It’s cold today.

今日は暑いです。//It’s hot today.

<br>

#### Adverbs

/// are words that modify adjectives, verbs, and other adverbs.

/// They normally express such concepts as quality, quantity, degree, or manner and are normally placed immediately before the words they modify.

<br>

今日は本当に寒いです。//It’s really cold today.

今日はとても暑いです。//It’s very hot today.

<br>

/// There are other kinds of adverbs that modify entire sentences.  One example is the time adverb

<br>

今日、日本はとても暑いです。//It’s very hot in Japan today.

<br>

### (4) Verbal predicates

<br>

分かりますか。//Do you understand?

ええ、よく分かります。//Yes, I understand well.

ずんだもんさんは分かりますか。//Do you understand, Zundamon-san?

ええ、（私は）よく分かります。//Yes, I understand well.

<br>

/// When the speaker judges that the addressee would know the referent, it is often deleted in Japanese. The referent can be the topic, the object, or some other noun or noun phrase in the sentence.

<br>

#### The direct object and the particle が (linking particle)

/// The particle が is used after a certain kind of direct object to indicate that the preceding noun is the direct object of the predicate

/// In Japanese, the direct object must be placed before the predicate.

<br>

ナースロボさんは日本語がよく分かります。//Naasurobo-san understands Japanese well.

<br>

#### The direct object and the particle を (linking particle)

/// を (pronounced “o” in modern Japanese when used in this way).

/// を is used for the direct object of an action predicate

/// が marks the direct object of a non-action predicate

<br>

私は日本語を勉強します。//I will study Japanese.

<br>

/// The directional particles に and へ (linking particles)

/// The destination of the movement is indicated by either the particle に or へ (へ is pronounced “e” only when it is used as a particle).

<br>

僕は日本に行きます。//I will go to Japan.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Pronouns

### (1) First-person

/// Choosing an appropriate pronoun depends on factors such as the gender of the speaker and addressee, the speech situation, and the region in which these pronouns are used, among others.

/// both 私 {わたくし}, the most formal first-person pronoun, and 私 {わたし}, which is also formal, may be used by both genders.

/// 私 {わたし} is very frequently used by female speakers in both formal and casual situations. In very casual circumstances, it may be pronounced あたし by female speakers rather than わたし.

/// 僕 {ぼく}, used exclusively by male speakers of all ages, is less formal and more conversational than 私 {わたし} when used by male speakers.

<br>

### (2) Second-person

#### Use of the personal name

/// is often used instead of a pronoun to refer to the addressee in Japanese.

<br>

ずんだもんさんは一年生ですか。//Are you a freshman, Zundamon-san?

<br>

#### Use of deletion

/// is also frequently used in addressing someone.

/// When speaking directly to the addressee, deletion is more common than using a pronoun or a personal name.

<br>

三年生ですか。//Are you in the third grade?

<br>

#### Use of second-person pronouns (e.g., あなた)

/// Most of the time, a speaker should avoid using あなた to address: an older person, a person who holds a professional position,

/// あなた may be used: between people in a similar social situation, by a person who has more authority in a society to address someone with less power

/// In most cases, it is more common to use the name of the addressee with the appropriate ending such as ~さん or ~先生 {せんせい}, or to use deletion, rather than using あなた.

<br>

### (3) Third-person

/// Use of the third-person personal pronouns 彼 {かれ} for “he” and 彼女 {かのじょ} for “she” is more frequent among younger speakers in informal situations.

<br>

#### Deleting elements in sentences

/// The speaker may delete an element, or more than one element, from sentences when he or she judges that the addressee will be able to identify the deleted element(s).

<br>

### (4) Demonstrative pronouns

/// A speaker will use a demonstrative pronoun to point (literally or figuratively) to a particular person or a thing.

<br>

#### For people

/// こちら -> a person close to the speaker: “this person here”

/// そちら -> a person close to the addressee: “that person near you”

/// あちら -> a person far from both the speaker and the addressee: “that person over there”

<br>

#### For things

/// これ -> thing(s) close to the speaker: “this thing”

/// それ -> thing(s) close to the addressee: “that thing”

/// あれ -> hing(s) far from both the speaker and the addressee: “that thing over there”

/// の “one(s)” is another pronoun to refer to things.

<br>

### (5) Plural pronouns

/// In personal pronouns, it is indicated by ~達 {たち} and ~ら. The use of ~達 is more formal than the use of ~ら. 

/// Though it is not obligatory, ~ら can also be used with demonstrative pronouns for things.

<br>

#### Plural markers with regular nouns

/// plural markers are used mainly for pronouns, but they can be used for some nouns (for animate things) as well: 学生達 {がくせいたち} or 学生ら {がくせいら} “students,” for example. In 友達 {ともだち} “friend,”

/// Some nouns may be repeated to indicate that they are plural, but for the most part, nouns do not indicate number. Whether a noun is singular or plural is inferred from the use of words that indicate quantity and/or the context.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Yes-No Question Sentences

/// A yes-no question sentence is formed by adding the sentence-final particle か to a statement sentence.

/// The word order of the statement sentence remains unchanged.

/// Yes-no question sentences should be spoken with rising intonation.

<br>



今日は寒いですか。//Is it cold today?

ナースロボさんは日本語が分かりますか。//Do you understand Japanese, Naasurobo-san?

<br>

### (2) Positive responses

#### Responding positively by repeating the predicate

/// One way to respond positively to a question is simply to repeat the predicate following the positive acknowledgement, はい or ええ, both of which mean “yes.” 

/// はい is more formal than ええ, but ええ is more commonly used in conversation. 

/// The topic is often deleted in responses.

<br>

ずんだもんさんは一年生ですか。//Are you a freshman, Zundamon-san?

はい、（私は）一年生です。//Yes, I am a freshman.

今日は寒いですか。//Is it cold today?

ええ、（今日は）寒いです。//Yes, it’s cold today.

<br>

ナースロボさんは分かりますか。//Do you understand, Naasurobo-san?

ええ、（僕は）分かります。//Yes, I understand.

<br>

#### The generic positive response そうです

/// may be used as the generic positive response for the nominal predicate.

/// そう, which literally means “that way,” should be used alone without a topic. 

/// そうです can be used only when responding to questions with nominal predicates, unless ねえ rather than か is used at the end of the predicate.

<br>

（あなたは）ずんだもんさんですか。//Are you Zundamon-san?

ええ、そうです。//Yes, that’s right.

<br>

### (3) Negative responses

#### The generic negative response 違います  {ちがいます}

/// is a verb that means “to differ from something.”

/// It can be used as a generic negative response to a question using the nominal predicate.

/// should be used without a topic. It should only be used to respond a question with a nominal predicate.

<br>

いいえ、違います。//No, I am not.

<br>

#### Giving the correct information

<br>

いいえ、違います。（私は）時雨です。//No, I’m not. I’m Shigure.

いいえ。（私は）時雨です。//No. I’m Shigure.

<br>

#### Negative responses

/// may be given by negating predicates.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Negating Predicates

### (1) Negating the nominal predicate

/// ->  [です → では (or じゃ) ありません]

/// Using the contracted じゃ is more conversational than では.

今日は寒くありません。//It’s not cold today.

<br>

/// original form of the adjective いい “good” is よい

/// いいです→よくありません

<br>

これはいいです。//This is good.

それはよくありません。//That is not good.

<br>

/// A nominal predicate with an adjective

/// A predicate containing an adjective that modifies a noun within that predicate is a nominal predicate, not an adjectival predicate. 

/// The negation is that of a nominal predicate rather than an adjectival predicate.

<br>

ずんだもんさんはいい学生ですか。//Is Zundamon-san a good student?

いいえ、（ずんだもんさんは）いい学生じゃありません。//No, she is not a good student.

# Stage 1-2 Question Sentences

<br>

## 1: Alternative Questions

### (1) The three types of question sentences

/// Elements like the topic, if it is the same in both clauses, need not be repeated in the second question.

<br>

あなたは雪ノ下さんですか、（あなたは）時雨さんですか。//Are you Yukinoshita-san or Shigure-san?

<br>

#### Clausal and sentential conjunction それとも

/// the use of the conjunction それとも in alternative questions is optional.

/// Using それとも makes the question sound more formal, so in a casual conversation, this conjunction is often omitted.

<br>

<br>

#### Noun phrasal conjunction か

<br>

家に帰りますか、勉強しますか。//Will you go home or study?

どちらもしません。//I will do neither.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Information-Seeking Question Sentences - need to use interrogative pronouns

/// Information-seeking question sentences are interrogative sentences that seek specific responses rather than simply “yes” or “no.” 

/// As is the case with yes-no questions, the word order is the same as in a declarative sentence.

<br>

### (1) だれ(誰), [どなた (何方)] “who?”

/// In order to ask for the name of a person

<br>

/// なん should be used when asking about a number with a counter or a part of a series

/// なに should be used to ask what things. However, when なに is followed by a word that begins with /t/, /d/, /r/ or /n/, then なん should be used. An exception to this is that before the particle に, either なん or なに can be used.

<br>

それは何ですか。//What is that?

（これは）本です。//This is a book.

<br>

### (3) どこ (何処) “where?”

## 3: Modifying Nouns

### (1) Modifying a noun with an adjective

/// when an adjective modifies a noun, no particle is used between the adjective and the noun it modifies.

<br>

今日はいい天気です。//The weather is good today.

<br>

### (2) Modifying a noun with another noun

/// the particle の must be placed between the two nouns

/// In this structure, the first noun always modifies (that is, explains, describes, or qualifies) the second noun.

/// Since the first noun modifies the second noun, reversing the order of the nouns changes the meaning of the sentence.

/// More than two nouns may be used to modify a noun. In all cases, the last noun is the main noun and all nouns preceding it modify it.

<br>

#### の and demonstrative pronouns

/// The particle の must be placed after these demonstrative pronouns if they are followed by a noun. -> この, その, and あの

<br>

これは本です。//This is a book.

この本は雪ノ下さんの本です。//This book is Yukinoshita-san’s book.

<br>

/// These demonstrative pronouns are also used for personal pronouns, この人, その人, あの人

/// These personal pronouns are less formal than こちら, そちら, and あちら. 

/// Furthermore, こちら, そちら, and あちら are used when the person the speaker refers to is physically present at the time of speech; この人 {このひと}, その人 {そのひと}, and あの人 {あのひと} do not have the same requirement.

<br>

/// The noun after の can be deleted if it is understood, especially when it is inanimate.

<br>

これは私の本です。それはあなたのです。//This is my book. That is yours.

それは私のではありません。//That is not mine.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Adjectival Nouns

### (1) Two types of adjectives: adjectives and adjectival nouns

/// adjectival nouns is a noun in terms of its form but an adjective in meaning.

/// The predicate with an adjectival noun is a nominal predicate. So, when a predicate with an adjectival noun is negated, the negative form of the copula is used

<br>

元気ですか。元気です。//How are you? I am fine.

元気ではありません。//I am not well.

元気じゃありません。//I am not well.

<br>

#### Descriptive particle な

/// the function of adjectives is to describe nouns; they can be used immediately before the nouns that they modify

/// When an adjectival noun modifies a noun, the particle な must be placed between the two words

<br>

今日はいい天気です。//It’s really nice weather today.

今日はいやな天気ですねえ。//It’s really bad weather today, isn’t it?

<br>

雪ノ下さんは元気な学生です。//Yukinoshita-san is an energetic student.

あの学生は元気です。//That student is full of energy.

<br>

#### Summary of how to modify nouns

/// an adjective modifies a noun, use nothing between them;

/// an adjectival noun modifies a noun, use な between them;

/// a noun modifies another noun, use の between them;

/// a verb modifies a noun, the verb must be in the plain form, and the noun follows immediately, with no particle between them.

<br>

### (2) Interrogative pronouns どれ (何れ), どの (何の) and どんな

#### Interrogative pronoun どんな

/// どんな is an interrogative pronoun related to the pronouns こんな, そんな, and あんな, meaning “this kind of,” “that kind of,” and “that kind of.” 

/// どんな therefore means “what kind of.”

/// They must be followed by nouns. な in this set is the same な that joins adjectival nouns and nouns.

<br>

こんな本は高いですか。はい、とても高いです。//Is this kind of book expensive? Yes, it is very expensive.

あの本はどんな本ですか。//What kind of book is that book over there?

<br>

#### Differences between どれ, どちら, and どの

/// どれ “which one” is the interrogative pronoun related to the pronouns これ, それ, and あれ

/// どの “which (noun)” is the interrogative pronoun related to the pronouns この, その, and あの.

/// a noun must follow どの, while どれ is used in isolation. 

/// In both cases, the question focuses on isolating one of many options.

<br>

あなたのかばんはどれですか。//Which one is your backpack?

あなたのかばんはどのかばんですか。//Which backpack is your backpack?

<br>

/// If there are only two options (rather than many), どちら should be used rather than どれ.

<br>

あなたのかばんはどちらですか。//Which one (of two) is your backpack?

あなたのかばんはどちらのかばんですか。//Which backpack  (of two)  is your backpack?

<br>

#### The difference between どんな and どの

/// Both どんな and どの must be followed by a noun. 

/// However, どんな asks for a description, whereas どの only asks for an identification.

<br>

アリスさんはどんな人ですか。//What kind of person is Alice-san?

（アリスさんは）元気な人です。//Alice-san is a cheerful person.

<br>

/// どの asks the listener to identify a specific thing or person out of the available options.

<br>

アリスさんは どの人ですか。//Which person is Alice-san?

（アリスさんは）あの人です。//Alice-san is that person over there.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Conjunctions

### (1) Clausal conjunction が

/// The conjunction が joins clauses, rather than sentences.

/// The conjunction が must be accompanied by a phrase divider, rather than a period.

<br>

/// Contrast: when the speaker wishes to contrast an element in each of the two clauses:

<br>

私は日本人ですが、ナースロボさんはアメリカ人です。//I am Japanese, but Naasurobo-san is American.

<br>

/// Contradiction: when the second clause makes a statement that disagrees in sense with what can be inferred from the first clause:

<br>

私は雪ノ下ですが、（私は）日本人じゃありません。//I am Yukinoshita, but I am not Japanese.

<br>

### (2) Sentential and clausal conjunction けれども

/// けれども, is very similar to が.

<br>

私は日本人ですけれども、ナースロボさんはアメリカ人です。//I am Japanese, but Naasurobo-san is American.

私は雪ノ下ですけれども、（私は）日本人じゃありません。//I am Yukinoshita, but I am not Japanese.

<br>

/// けれども can also function like でも, because it can join two separate sentences.

<br>

私は日本人です。けれども、ナースロボさんはアメリカ人です。//I am Japanese, but Naasurobo-san is American.

私は雪ノ下です。けれども、（私は）日本人じゃありません。//I am Yukinoshita, but I am not Japanese.

<br>

/// More casual forms of けれども delete certain syllables: they are けれど, けど, and (less frequently) け ども.

/// The fewer the number of syllables this conjunction has, the less formal it sounds.

<br>

#### Summary of でも, が, and けれども

/// でも：must be used between two separate sentences

/// が：must be used between two separate clauses

/// けれども：may be used between two separate sentences or between two clauses

<br>

/// が is more formal than けれども. 

/// けれども is more formal than でも, especially when all four syllables are used. 

/// When the number of syllables of けれども is reduced, as in けど, it is less formal than でも.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 6: Adverbs with Negative Predicates

/// Adverbs give a sense of the degree of the description or the degree of the negation that the speaker wishes to convey to the addressee in the predicate.

<br>

/// In Japanese, a speaker must in some cases use different adverbs for positive and negative sentences.

/// Some adverbs are therefore used only with negative predicates.

/// adverbs can soften or strengthen the negation.

<br>

#### あまり

/// とても is used with a positive response while あまり is used with a negative one.

<br>

あの先生はいい先生ですか。//Is that teacher a good teacher?

とてもいい先生です。//She is a very good teacher.

あまりいい先生ではありません。//She is not a very good teacher.

あまりいい先生じゃありません。//She is not a very good teacher.

<br>

/// There are cases in which あまり is used with positive predicates, but the meaning is quite Different

<br>

#### そんなに 

/// is used with a negative predicate, corrects the degree to which a description is assumed or presented to be true.

<br>

雪ノ下さんは本当にいい学生ですねえ。//Yukinoshita-san is really a good student, isn’t she?

雪ノ下さんはそんなにいい学生じゃありません。//Yukinoshita-san is not that good.

<br>

/// そんなに therefore refers back to some previously mentioned, or simply assumed, evaluation.

/// This assumption may be made by the addressee as well as by the speaker. あまり does not imply such reference.

<br>

#### 全然  {ぜんぜん}

/// negates the description in the predicate completely.

<br>

日本は寒いですか。//Is it cold in Japan?

全然、寒くありません。//It is not cold at all.

<br>

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Backchanneling

<br>

あなた達は二年生ですか、三年生ですか。//Are you sophomores or a third grader?

二年生でも三年生でもありません。一年生ですよ。//Neither. Actually, we’re freshmen.

一年生ですか。//You’re freshmen, are you?

<br>

/// The function of this kind of repeated sentence is to give the addressee an acknowledgement that one is listening; 

/// very similar expressions to “oh?” “I see,” or “uh-huh” in English

<br>

### (2) Location or name?

<br>

花澤さんの大学はどこですか。//Which university do you go to?

京都の大学です。//I go to a university in Kyoto.

<br>

### (3) Changing the topic or making a conclusion

<br>

それは何ですか。//What is that?

かばんです。でも、僕のじゃありません。//It’s a backpack. But it’s not mine.

じゃ、これは？//How about this one, then?

ああ、それは僕のです。//Oh, that one’s mine.

<br>

/// To change the topic or make a conclusive statement, a speaker may use じゃ ( or では in a more formal situation).

<br>

### (4) Repeating the question before answering

<br>

雪ノ下さんの専攻は何ですか。//What is your major, Naasurobo-san?

専攻ですか。日本語です。//My major? It’s Japanese.

<br>

/// Japanese people tend to repeat a word, a phrase, or sometimes even an entire sentence from the question that was asked before giving a response.

/// This is not rude; it is just a way to confirm that the speaker is responding to the right question. 

/// It also provides an extra moment to think about the response to the question.stage １，３。

# Stage 1-3 Aspects of Predicates

## 1: Four Aspects

/// In Japanese, the forms of the predicate indicate aspect rather than tense.

/// Rather than referring to the time of an action or event, aspect refers to such things as whether an action or event is completed, continuous, etc.

<br>

/// Time in Japanese is expressed and interpreted by way of the use of an aspectual form of the predicate together with other elements such as a time adverb and/or context.

<br>

/// In Japanese, all predicates have two aspectual forms: imperfective and perfective.

/// Both imperfective and perfective forms of predicates have positive and negative forms as well.

<br>

/// The imperfective form is used to express 

/// 1. an action that is not completed (for action verbs), or 

/// 2. the current state (for non-action predicates).

<br>

/// The perfective form is used for

/// 1. an action that is or has been completed (for action verbs), or

/// 2. the past state (for non-action predicates).

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Positive and negative imperfectives

#### Action verbs

/// The imperfective form of an action verb indicates that the action has not been completed. 

/// Therefore, this form can be used for future action, as in the sentence “I will read a book tonight.”

/// It is also used to express habitual action with no specific time reference as in “I usually read a book before I go to bed.”

/// The difference between future and habitual actions is indicated by the use of certain time adverbs or by the context.

<br>

私は明日、本を読みます。//I will read a book tomorrow.

私は毎日、本を読みます。//I read books every day.

<br>

/// The imperfective positive form does not indicate ongoing action that is currently taking place: “I’m reading a book now.”

<br>

/// the use of negative imperfective forms also indicates negation of either habitual or future actions.

/// the key to distinguishing the habitual from the future sense is the use of time adverbs or context.

<br>

私は明日、本を読みません。//I will not read a book tomorrow.

私は毎日、本を読みません。//I don’t read books every day.

<br>

#### Non-action predicates

/// Nominal, adjectival, and some verbal predicates do not refer to actions.

/// For these predicates, the imperfective forms indicate the current state rather than future or habitual.

<br>

僕は一年生です。//I am a freshman.

僕は一年生じゃありません。//I am not a freshman.

<br>

今日は寒いです。//It is cold today.

今日は寒くありません。//It is not cold today.

<br>

ナースロボさんは日本語が話せます。//Naasurobo-san can speak Japanese.

ナースロボさんは日本語が話せません。//Naasurobo-san cannot speak Japanese.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Aspects of nominal predicates

#### Positive perfective forms

/// -> [です → でした]

/// Aspects of the nominal predicate are expressed by the forms of the copula.

<br>

私は学生です。//I’m a student.

私は学生でした。//I was a student.

<br>

#### Negative perfective forms

/// -> [(the negative imperfective predicate) + でした]

/// Change the predicate to the negative imperfective form first, and then add でした.

<br>

私は一年生ではありませんでした。//I wasn’t a freshman.

私は一年生じゃありませんでした。//I wasn’t a freshman.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Aspects of adjectival predicates

#### Positive perfective forms

/// -> [~い → ~かった + です]

/// です functions as the marker for the polite form.

<br>

大きいです。大きかったです。//is big. was big.

いいです。よかったです。//is good. was good.

<br>

#### Negative perfective forms

/// -> [(the negative imperfective predicate) + でした]

/// Change the predicate to the negative imperfective form first, and then add でした.

<br>



昨日は寒くありませんでした。//It wasn’t cold yesterday.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (5) Aspects of verbal predicates

#### Positive perfective forms

/// -> [~ます → ~ました]

<br>

昨日、私は日本語を勉強しました。//I studied Japanese yesterday.

<br>

日本語が話せました。//I used to be able to speak Japanese.

<br>

#### Negative perfective forms

/// -> [(the negative imperfective predicate) + でした]

/// Change the predicate into the negative imperfective form first, and then add でした.

<br>

昨日、勉強しませんでした。//I didn’t study yesterday.

<br>

日本語が話せませんでした。//I wasn’t able to speak Japanese.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Other Aspects

### (1) Continuous aspect

/// The continuous aspect of action verbs is constructed by combining what is called the conjunctive form of a verb and another verb, います.

/// In meaning, this construction conveys any continuous aspect of action verbs.

<br>

僕は本を読みます。//I will read a book. I normally read a book.

<br>

僕は本を読んでいます。//I am reading a book (now). I have been reading a book.

僕は本を読んでいません。//I’m not reading a book now. I have not been reading a book.

僕は本を読んでいました。//I was reading a book then. I had been reading a book.

僕は本を読んでいませんでした。//I wasn’t reading a book then. I had not been reading a book.

<br>

#### Conjunctive forms of predicates

/// While the rules for deriving the conjunctive forms from the base forms of the nominal and adjectival predicates are simple, the rules for deriving the conjunctive forms of verbs are quite complex.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Volitional aspect

#### The volitional forms of verbs

/// -> [~ます → ~ましょう]

/// is used when the speaker wants to suggest some action to the addressee(s) that would include the speaker himself or herself, as in “Let’s do such-and-such.”

<br>

行きます。//will go

行きましょう。//Let’s go.

行きましょうか。//Shall we go?

<br>

/// Certain verbs, such as non-action verbs, cannot be used to mean “let’s do such-and-such,” but every verb has a volitional form because the volitional forms are used in other constructions for different meanings.

<br>

#### The volitional form of the copula -> [です→ でしょう]

/// may be used with all predicate types: nominal, adjectival, and verbal predicates.

/// The copula です is used when the speaker is certain about the content of a sentence.

/// When the speaker is not absolutely certain, but fairly sure, about the content expressed in the predicate, then the volitional でしょう is used.

/// The adverb 多分 {たぶん} “perhaps, probably” is often used in a sentence with でしょう, although it is not an obligatory element.

<br>

あの人は学生でしょう。//That person is probably a student.

<br>

多分このかばんは高いでしょう。//This backpack is probably expensive.

<br>

/// For verbal predicates, the plain form of the verb must be used before でしょう

<br>

ナースロボさんは日本語が分かるでしょう。//Naasurobo-san probably understands Japanese.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) A summary of aspectual forms

<br>

#### Nominal predicates

<br>

一年生です。//I’m a freshman.

一年生ではありません。//I’m not a freshman.

一年生でした。//I was a freshman.

一年生ではありませんでした。//I wasn’t a freshman.

一年生でしょう。//[Someone else] is probably a freshman.

<br>

#### Adjectival predicates

<br>

今日は寒いです。//It is cold today.

今日は寒くありません。//It is not cold today.

今日は寒かったです。//It was cold today.

今日は寒くありませんでした。//It was not cold today.

今日は寒いでしょう。//It is probably cold today.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates (non-action verbs)

<br>

日本語が話せます。//I can speak Japanese.

日本語が話せません。//I can’t speak Japanese.

日本語が話せました。//I could speak Japanese.

日本語が話せませんでした。//I couldn’t speak Japanese.

日本語が話せるでしょう。//[Someone] can probably speak Japanese.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates (action verbs)

日本語を勉強していません。//I’m not studying Japanese.

日本語を勉強していました。//I was studying Japanese.

日本語を勉強していませんでした。//I wasn’t studying Japanese.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Conjunctions

### (1) Sentential conjunctions その前に, その後で, and その時に

/// When nouns such as 前 {まえ} “before,” 後 {あと} “after,” and 時 {とき} “time,” are used with the demonstrative その, they function as sentential conjunctions (i.e., conjunctions that connect two sentences).

<br>

私は去年、日本に行きました。その前（に）、日本語を勉強しました。//I went to Japan last year. Before that, I studied Japanese.

映画を見ました。その後（で）、ハンバーグを食べました。//I watched a movie. After that, I ate a hamburger.

去年、日本に行きました。その時（に）、日本語を勉強しました。//I went to Japan last year. At that time, I studied Japanese.

<br>

#### Noun with 前, 後, and 時

<br>

朝ご飯の前（に）、勉強しました。//Before breakfast, I studied.

朝ご飯の後（で）、勉強しました。//After breakfast, I studied.

朝ご飯の時（に）、勉強しました。//During breakfast, I studied.

<br>

### (2) Sentential conjunction だから

/// is used at the beginning of a second sentence to indicate a consequence that follows from the first sentence.

/// The first sentence shows the reason for the consequence expressed in the second sentence.

<br>

私は日本語が分かりませんでした。だから、英語を話しました。//I didn’t understand Japanese, so I spoke English.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Joining Predicates with Conjunctive Forms

### (1) Limitations ofと

/// the conjunction と joins only nouns and noun phrases, but may not be used to join predicates or sentences.

/// The reason と is acceptable in the following sentence is that the two nouns are joined in one predicate.

<br>

先生はずんだもん先生と時雨先生です。//The teachers are Zundamon-sensei and Shigure-sensei.

<br>

### (2) First predicate as nominal predicate

/// The conjunctive form of the copula is で.

/// Use で to join a nominal predicate to another predicate

/// also with a nominal predicate that consists of an adjectival noun and the copula.

<br>

僕はナースロボで、日本語の学生です。//I’m Naasurobo, and I’m a student of Japanese.

エイミーさんは元気で、きれいです。//Amy-san is cheerful and pretty.

<br>

### (3) First predicate as adjectival predicate

/// The conjunctive form of an adjective is obtained by changing the final ~い to ~くて

<br>

中国は大きくて、遠いです。//China is large. It’s also far away.

日本語の授業はよくて、楽しいです。//My Japanese class is good as well as fun.

<br>

### (4) First predicate as verbal predicate

#### Action verbs

/// The conjunctive form of the verb します is して.

<br>

私は勉強して、運動します。//I will study and then exercise.

<br>

/// When two action verbs are joined by the conjunctive form, the order of the actions is expressed by the order of their presentation.

/// That is, in interpreting the sentence, the listener understands that the action expressed first will be completed before the action expressed second.

<br>

私は勉強して、運動しました。//I studied and then exercised.

<br>

#### Non-action verbs

/// In sentences with non-action verbs, the meaning is not affected by the order of the predicates.

<br>

あの人は英語も話せて、漢字も読めます。//That person can speak English as well as read kanji.

<br>

/// Since the sentence order does not assume an order of events, it is possible to reverse the order of the above sentence without changing the meaning:

<br>

あの人は漢字も読めて、英語も話せます。//That person can read kanji as well as speak English.

<br>

#### When the topics are different

/// When the topics of the two predicates to be joined are different, the order of the predicates does not imply the order of the actions, even if action verbs are used.

<br>

昨日、僕は勉強して、時雨さんは運動しました。//I studied yesterday, but Shigure-san exercised.

<br>

/// In a real situation, any number of predicates may be joined.

/// In this case, all except the final predicate are joined by using the conjunctive form.

<br>

寮の部屋はきれいで、小さいです。//The dorm room is clean and small.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Particles

### (1) Thematic について

/// indicating that the preceding noun is the theme of speaking, reading, writing, and so forth.

<br>

私は明日、日本について話します。//I will talk about Japan tomorrow.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Accompaniment と

/// と used as a particle indicates accompaniment.

<br>

私はナースロボさんと映画に行きます。//I will go to a movie with Naasurobo-san.

昨日、（僕は）ずんだもん先生と話しました。//I talked with Zundamon-sensei yesterday.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Instrumental で

/// The particle で gives the instrumental function to the preceding noun,

/// which means that the noun preceding the particle refers to the means by which the event described in the verb is accomplished or carried out.

<br>

日本人は箸で食べます。//Japanese people eat with chopsticks.

（僕は）学校にいつもバスで行きます。//I always go to school by bus.

<br>

/// When the means refers to an action, as in “by walking,” the conjunctive form of a verb is used.

<br>

私は学校にいつも歩いて行きます。//I always go to school on foot.

<br>

#### The place particle で marking the place of action

/// で is used with a place noun to indicate that the action of the verb in the sentence occurs in that place.

/// で here is also instrumental, expressing the use of a place for the action.

<br>

チャンさんは新聞を図書館で読みます。//Chang-san will read the newspaper at the library.

<br>

/// Compare this with the directional particle に:

<br>

チャンさんは図書館に行きます。//Chang-san will go to the library.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 6: Topic and Contrastive は

### (1) Topicalizing an element

/// In Japanese, the speaker can make any element the topic of a sentence by bringing it to the sentence-initial position and marking it with は.

<br>

来年もナースロボさんは日本語を勉強しますか。//Naasurobo-san, will you study Japanese next year as well?

中国語は勉強しませんが、日本語を勉強します。//[As for Chinese,] I will not study it, but I will study Japanese.

<br>

### (2) Contrastive は

/// は also has another function: that is, the contrastive function.

/// The topic can be inherently contrastive.

/// Since the speaker has chosen one element as the focus of his or her comments, that topic is implicitly or explicitly contrasted with some other elements.

<br>

これは私の本ですが、あれはエミリーさんのです。//This book is mine, but that one is EmiLy-san’s.

私は、本は読みますが、新聞は読みません。//I will read a book, but not a newspaper.

<br>

/// when two or more noun phrases are marked by は in a sentence, the first noun (or noun phrase) marked by は is usually the topic of the sentence; any subsequent ones are contrastive elements.

<br>

/// With the exception of particles that are conjunctive in nature such as の, and overriding particles,

/// the same particle may not be used for the same function more than once in a clause or a sentence.

/// Because it is common for a single particle to have multiple functions, as long as the function of the particle is different each time it is used, the same particle may be used multiple times in a sentence.

<br>

/// は, used contrastively and for topicalization, is an overriding particle. Generally speaking, overriding particles replace the particles が and を, and are used together with other particles.

/// In the following example, the particle に is used with the contrastive は:

<br>

今日は、日本語の授業には行きません。//I will not go to Japanese class today.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Confirming with ね

<br>

アリスさんは二年生ですね。//Alice-san, you’re a sophomore, right?

ええ、そうです。//Yes, I am.

<br>

/// The use of ね with a short vowel indicates that the speaker is confirming his or her understanding of a situation with the addressee.

<br>

### (2) Indirectness in conversation

<br>

アリスさんは二年生ですね。//Alice-san, you’re a sophomore, right?

いえ、僕は三年生ですが・・・。//No, I’m a third grader, but . . . [why do you ask?]

<br>

#### Incomplete sentences in conversation

/// The conjunction が at the end of the second sentence in the example above indicates that the sentence is not quite finished, but the speaker has decided not to continue.

/// This kind of unfinished sentence marked by が happens quite often in conversation in Japanese. Though it sounds very vague, sometimes not finishing a sentence is more polite than saying everything.

<br>

### (3) Confirming with か

<br>

日本語は難しくありませんか。//Isn’t Japanese hard for you?

難しいです。//You’re right. It is difficult.

<br>

日本語は難しくありませんか。//Isn’t Japanese hard for you?

いいえ。易しいです。//I don’t think so. It’s easy.

<br>

#### Negative questions with か

/// A question is often asked with a negative predicate when the speaker is fairly certain about something but not 100 percent certain.

<br>

この本は高くありませんか。//This book is expensive, isn’t it?

<br>

/// the addressee uses ええ to agree with the assumption

<br>

ええ。高いです。//You’re right. It is expensive.

<br>

/// いいえ is used to show that the addressee’s assumption is somewhat different from the reality.

/// So, the actual fact is added after indicating that the addressee’s assumption is incorrect by the use of いいえ.

<br>

いいえ。高くありません。//You are incorrect. It is not expensive.

<br>

### (4) Confirming with ねえ

<br>

日本語は易しくありませんねえ。//Japanese isn’t easy, don’t you think so?

ええ、本当に易しくありませんねえ。//You’re right, it’s not easy.

<br>

#### Negative questions with ねえ

/// When the speaker is trying to convey his or her impression with a negative predicate and wants to confirm that impression with the addressee, the sentence-final particle ねえ is often used in a question

<br>

この本は高くありませんねえ。//This book is not expensive, don’t you agree?

ええ、そんなに高くありませんねえ。//You are right. It is not that expensive.

そうですか。高いです。//Really? It is expensive.

<br>

### (5) Avoiding bluntness

<br>

日本語は易しくありませんねえ。//Japanese isn’t easy, don’t you think so?

そうですか。あんまり難しくありませんが・・・。//Really? It’s not that difficult, but . . .

<br>

#### そうですか

/// At times, giving a negative response with いいえ or いえ may be too blunt. In this case, it is possible to acknowledge the question by saying そうですか, which softens the bluntness of the response.

<br>

/// あんまり is a spoken form of あまり.stage １，４。

# Stage 1-4 Numbers and Counters

<br>

## 1: Numbers

### (1) Native Japanese and Sino-Japanese numbers

/// For the numbers 1 through 10, there are two systems of counting.

/// One is the native Japanese number system; the other, the Sino-Japanese number system, is borrowed from the Chinese.

/// 一、二、三、四、五、六、七、八、九、十。//1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

<br>

#### From 1,000 to 9,000 

/// 千 (せん)

/// the “1” in 1,000 is normally neither pronounced nor written.

<br>

#### From 10,000 to 90,000

/// 万 (まん)

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Counters

### (1) What are counters?

/// In Japanese, counters are expressed by suffixes used immediately following the numbers.

/// Counters are thus not independent words and cannot be used in isolation.

/// Logically, all numbers must be used with appropriate counters depending on what is being counted.

<br>

### (2) Time

#### 時 {じ} for the specific hour

<br>

三時十五分すぎです。//It’s 15 minutes past 3:00.

<br>

/// The term to indicate the half hour is 半 {はん}.

/// When using 半 {はん} “half,” the word すぎ “past” or the counter 分 {ふん} may not be added.

<br>

<br>

/// When the time is close to the next hour, 前 {まえ}, which means “before,” can be used

<br>

/// It is therefore used for such things as ranking.

/// This counter is also used to indicate telephone numbers.

<br>

## 3: Using Numbers in Sentences

/// Numbers can function adjectivally or adverbially.

<br>

### (1) Adverbial use

/// When it is used adverbially, the number should be used before the verb and without any particle.

/// this counter can be used in any position except at the end of the sentence

<br>

私はペンを二本、買いました。//I bought two pens.

私は二本、ペンを買いました。//I bought two pens.

<br>

### (2) Adjectival use

/// A number can also modify a noun.

/// When a number is used adjectivally, it must be placed immediately before the noun it modifies. The particle の must be placed between them.

<br>

/// When a number modifies a noun, the meaning of the phrase is quite different from the structure in which a number is used adverbially.

/// The speaker is referring only to a specific things. In this case, the noun modified by the number can be deleted.

<br>

一本（のペン）はルームメートのです。//One (of the pens) is my roommate’s

<br>

### (3) Joining more than one number in a sentence

/// One way is to make two separate sentences joined by a sentential conjunction.

<br>

ペンを五本、買いました。そして、本を三冊、買いました。//I bought five pens. Also, I bought three books.

<br>

/// When the predicate is the same, another way is to join the noun phrases (the numbers and the nouns) with the conjunction と

<br>

ペンを五本と本を三冊、買いました。//I bought five pens and three books.

<br>

### (4) The use of ずつ

/// When the number and the counter are the same for two different objects (e.g., three pens and three pencils), there is no need to repeat the number twice.

/// Instead, the word ずつ, which means “each,” should be used after the counter.

<br>

ペンと鉛筆を三本ずつ買いました。。//I bought three pens and three pencils.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Getting someone’s attention

<br>

あのう、すみません、今、何時ですか。//Uh . . . excuse me, but what time is it now?

さあ、何時でしょうか。//Let’s see . . . I wonder what time it might be?

<br>

/// あのう is an utterance used when the speaker wants to hesitate a bit before speaking. This may also be a way to gain the attention of the addressee before starting to speak.

<br>

/// さあ indicates that the speaker is unsure of the response to the question asked.

<br>

### (2) Expressing surprise

<br>

これ、いくらでした。//How much was this?

ちょうど五万円でした。//It was exactly 50,000 yen.

へえ、随分、高いですねえ。//Are you serious? That’s a lot more than I thought.

<br>

#### A question without か

/// When speaking colloquially, the sentence-final particle か may be omitted. In this case, the sentence must be uttered with a rising intonation.

<br>

/// The utterance へえ indicates that the speaker did not expect the answer that was given. へえ thus expresses surprise. This must be said with a rising intonation.

<br>

### (3) At a store

# Stage 1-5 On Verbs

## 1: Verbs of Existence

### (1) Expressing existence in English and Japanese

/// The verb “to be” (am, are, is) in English is used to indicate two different meanings: that of identification and that of existence.

<br>

/// In Japanese, identification and existence must be expressed by separate predicates:

/// the copula だ （です） is used for identification, and the verbs いる（います） and ある（あります） are used for existence.

<br>

/// Which verb to use when expressing existence depends on the topic.

/// When the topic is animate (people, animals, etc.), the verb いる（います） should be used;

/// when the topic is inanimate, the verb ある（あります） should be used.

<br>

学生は家にいます。//The student is at home.

本は家にあります。//The book is at home.

<br>

#### Animate vs. inanimate

/// いる (居る): living things that can move on their own (such as people and animals) are considered animate; 

/// ある (有る, 在る): anything, living or not, that cannot move on its own (such as plants and household objects) is considered inanimate.

/// The existence of animals that do not move, such as clams, is expressed with ある（あります） as well.

<br>

#### Place pronouns

/// ここ。here; そこ。there;あそこ。over there; どこ。an inquiry regarding place.

<br>

#### Location particle に

/// The location of existence is marked by the particle に

<br>

学生はここにいます。//The student is here.

本はあそこにあります。//The book is over there.

<br>

/// The particle で with the verb ある（あります）

/// When the sentence implies some action, the particle で must be used along with the place noun, even with the verb ある（あります）

<br>

試験はあそこにあります。//The exam paper is over there.

試験はあそこであります。//The exam will be held over there.

<br>

パーティーはあの部屋であります。//The party will be held in that room.

<br>

#### Specific locations

/// Specific locations are expressed with nouns such as 前 {まえ} “front” and 後ろ {うしろ} “back.”

/// These specific locations are usually modified by a reference point.

/// The particle の is used between the two nouns, with the modifying noun followed by the modified noun.

<br>

私の鞄は椅子の前にあります。//My backpack is in front of the chair.

私の鞄は椅子の後ろにあります。//My backpack is behind of the chair.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Word order and particles

#### Definite vs. indefinite nouns

/// In English, definite nouns (those that refer to a specific item) and indefinite nouns (those that refer to a non-specific item) can be identified by the use of the definite article “the” and the indefinite articles “a” and “an”:

<br>

/// Japanese does not have articles to indicate whether a noun is definite or indefinite.

/// Interpreting what is definite and indefinite is therefore related to what is known and new information.

<br>

#### Known vs. new information

/// In Japanese, newer information (from the addressee’s point of view) tends to be placed at a later point in the sentence.

<br>

鞄に本があります。//There is a book in my bag.

本は鞄にあります。//The book is in the bag.

<br>

/// the use of が indicates the topic is new information

<br>

鞄に何がありますか。//What’s in the bag?

（鞄に）本があります。//There is a book in the bag.

<br>

本はどこにありますか。//Where is the book?

（本は）鞄にあります。//The book is in the bag.

<br>

/// Indicating whether nouns are definite or indefinite in other grammatical structures may be accomplished by other means, such as the use of demonstrative pronouns （e.g., その本） or the context in which the nouns are used.

<br>

#### Noun phrasal conjunction や

/// と is used to join two or more nouns or noun phrases.

/// The conjunction や functions in the same way; however, the implication when や is used is different than when と is used.

/// When two or more nouns are joined by や, the implication is that more things are involved than those mentioned in the sentence.

<br>

ここにコーヒーとお茶があります。//There is coffee and tea here.

ここにコーヒーやお茶があります。//There is coffee and tea here (and other things as well).

<br>

#### だ（です）as the abbreviated predicate

/// The three functions of the copula include 

/// 1. equating the topic and the predicate; 

/// 2. providing the conjugations for the nominal predicate; 

/// 3. marking the speech style for the nominal and adjectival predicates.

<br>

/// In addition to these three functions, the copula can also be used as a substitute for the understood predicate.

/// In conversation, one-word responses are quite common. The predicate may be deleted in these cases, but in place of the predicate, the copula can be used.

/// particle will normally not be used between the single word and だ（です）.

<br>

私の本はどこにありますか。//Where’s my book?

ここです。//It’s here.

<br>

昨日、どこに行きましたか。//Where did you go yesterday?

ニューヨークです。//New York.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) The honorific いらっしゃる（いらっしゃいます）

/// 敬語 {けいご} is the term for “honorifics” in Japanese.

<br>

/// Politeness, as it relates to the relationship between speaker and addressee, is expressed through the use of the verb ending ~ます in the verbal predicate, or です in the nominal and adjectival predicates.

<br>

/// The use of an honorific predicate reflects the respect felt by the speaker toward the person in the topic position in a sentence.

/// The honorific predicate is never used when a member of the speaker’s family or immediate circle is the topic.

<br>

母はアメリカにいます。//My mother is in America.

エイミー先生はアメリカにいらっしゃいます。//Amy-sensei is in America.

<br>

/// This honorific verb いらっしゃる（いらっしゃいます） is used as the verb for existence, as well as for the verbs “to come” and “to go.”

<br>

先生は大学にいらっしゃいました。//The teacher was at the college.

<br>

/// or “The teacher went to the college.”

/// or “The teacher came to the college.”

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Transitivity of Predicates

/// The three types of predicates transitivity, they are categorized as transitive, intransitive, and semi-transitive predicates.

<br>

### (1) Transitive

/// A transitive predicate requires a direct object in a sentence.

/// The use of a transitive predicate indicates that the topic is acting physically or mentally upon, or is moving, the direct object.

/// This kind of predicate therefore expresses actions.

<br>

/// the direct object of a transitive verb is marked by the particle を.

<br>

毎日、学生は本を読みます。//Students read books every day.

<br>

/// It is important to note that classification of transitivity between two languages such as Japanese and English does not correlate directly.

<br>

#### Two-object transitive predicates

/// Some transitive predicates require two objects for a concept to be complete

/// as in the English sentence “I wrote a letter to my mother.” 

/// In such a case, what the subject wrote—a letter—is the direct object, because the subject operates on it directly.

/// The person to whom the letter was addressed, “my mother,” is the indirect object; it receives the direct object and is thus affected indirectly by the action of the subject.

<br>

#### Indirect object particle に

/// the indirect object is marked by the particle に. This is similar to the directional particle に.

/// thus the indirect object is related to destination.

<br>

/// The order of the two objects may be changed without affecting the meaning of the sentence (except for the newness of information provided by the speaker) as long as the correct particles are used:

<br>

私は母にメールを書きました。//I wrote an e-mail message to my mother.

私はメールを母に書きました。//I wrote an e-mail message to my mother.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Intransitive

/// Unlike the topic of a transitive predicate, the topic of an intransitive predicate is itself what undergoes the action, carries out the movement, or experiences the emotions expressed by the predicate.

/// An intransitive predicate does not have a direct object, but may contain other elements, such as the destination of a movement.

<br>

エイミーさんは明日、日本に行きます。//Amy-san will go to Japan tomorrow.

エイミーさんは明日、日本へ行きます。//Amy-san will go to Japan tomorrow.

<br>

/// Although に and へ may be used interchangeably with directional verbs, に is preferred when the verb is 来る {くる}（きます） “to come.”

<br>

エイミーさんは昨日、ここに来ました。//Amy-san came here yesterday.

<br>

#### を with intransitive verbs

/// The particle を has been introduced as the direct object marker of transitive verbs.

/// This particle is also used with intransitive verbs that express movement from the topic’s original location to another place (either outside of the original place or within that space).

/// This function of を in this case is to mark where the topic “passes through the place.” Thus, the verbs associated with this particle are those that express directional movement, such as “to pass,” “to walk,” “to run,” “to go out,” “to drive,” etc.

<br>

私は町まで歩きました。//I walked to town.

私は町で歩きました。//I walked in town.

私は町を歩きました。//I walked through town.

<br>

/// The particle を is also used with verbs such as 卒業する {そつぎょうする}（します） “to graduate,” 出る {でる} （でます） “to leave” (a place), and 休む {やすむ}（やすみます） “to rest.” 

/// The nuance is that the topic goes out from a location after passing through the space enclosed by the location

<br>

昨日、家を出ました。//He left home yesterday.

去年、高校を卒業しました。//I graduated from high school last year.

<br>

明日、学校を休みます。//I will not come to school tomorrow.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Semi-transitive

/// The predicates categorized as semi-transitive share characteristics of both transitive and intransitive predicates.

/// They resemble transitive predicates because they require a direct object. Unlike transitive predicates, however, the topic of a semi-transitive predicate does not move or operate on the object.

/// Instead, it experiences or goes through a stative condition such as the possession of a thing, ability, or emotional need. In this way, semi-transitive predicates resemble intransitive predicates.

/// The direct object of a semi-transitive predicate must be marked by が rather than を.

<br>

/// Compare the following two sentences with different verbs: 

/// 話す {はなす}（はなします） “to speak” is a transitive verb, which indicates the action of speaking.

/// 話せる {はなせる}（はなせます） “to be able to speak” is a semi-transitive verb that indicates one’s ability to speak.

<br>

ナースロボさんはいつもずんだもんさんに日本語を話します。//Naasurobo-san always speaks Japanese to Zundamon-san.

ナースロボさんは日本語が話せます。//Smith-san can speak Japanese.

<br>

/// other kinds of predicates may have direct objects marked by が as well.

<br>

私はもっと時間が欲しいです。//I want more time.

僕は犬が怖いです。//I’m afraid of dogs.

<br>

私は寿司が好きです。//I like sushi.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Verbs of Giving and Receiving

### (1) うち vs. そと

/// うち (in-group): A group to which the speaker belongs: this group can be a family, a company, a club, etc. The in-group may change from situation to situation.

<br>

妹は姉にセーターを上げました。//My little sister gave my big sister a sweater.

<br>

小夜さんは先生に花を差し上げました。//Sayo-san gave her teacher some flowers.

<br>

#### 下さる {くださる}（くださいます）

/// As with くれる（くれます）, when the receiver is the speaker, the use of 私に or 僕に may be unnecessary.

<br>

エイミー先生は妹に花を下さいました。//Amy-sensei gave my younger sister some flowers.

<br>

/// As in the case of くれる（くれます）, when the topic gives something to someone who is not the speaker or a member of the speaker’s うち-group, this verb may not be used.

<br>

<br>

#### A summary of giving/receiving verbs

/// When the topic is the giver:

/// Giver -> [さしあげる, あげる, やる]

<br>

/// When the topic is the giver and the receiver is the speaker or うち-group:

/// Giver - [くださる, くれる] -> うち as Receiver

<br>

/// When the topic is the receiver:

/// Receiver <- [いただく, もらう]

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Particles

### (1) の with other particles

/// the particle の joins two nouns or noun phrases, in which the first noun modifies the second.

<br>

友達の手紙。//my friend’s letter.

<br>

/// The phrase above is ambiguous, however. 

/// It can refer to a letter that is written by the speaker’s friend, or a letter that came to his/her friend, or something else.

<br>

### (2) Overriding particles だけ and しか

/// That is, だけ may be used along with the original particles, but this usage is optional

<br>

私だけ（が）日本に行きました。//Only I went to Japan.

私はコーヒーだけ（を）飲みました。//I drank only coffee.

/// However, だけ is normally used with other particles such as に or で. The order of the two particles is flexible.

<br>

私は日本にだけ行きました。//I went only to Japan.

私は日本だけに行きました。//I went only to Japan.

<br>

#### しか

/// The overriding particles だけ and しか share a similar meaning, but when しか is used, the predicate must be in the negative form.

/// The sentence with しか emphasizes the negative aspect of the sentence, while だけ highlights the positive aspect.

<br>

私は朝、コーヒーだけ飲みます。//I drink only coffee in the morning.

<br>

/// Unlike だけ, しか must follow the original particle; it may not precede it.

<br>

/// （いつも）(always)       いつか sometime/anytime

/// どれも not one thing    どれか one of the things

/// どちらも neither one    どちらか one of the two

<br>

/// Except for いつも, which does not have a negative meaning, the above pronouns formed with も require the predicate to be in the negative form.

/// も replaces は, が, or を, but is used along with other particles.

<br>

<br>

/// the quotative particle と connects the verb and the content of the quote, thoughts, or sounds.

/// The use of this particle is optional when the onomatopoeia contains repeated syllables.

<br>

/// When reporting only the content rather than something verbatim, remove the quotation marks and use the plain form for the content.

<br>

#### Expressing thoughts

/// the speaker may express an opinion or idea by connect ing his or her own thought with と and the verb 思う {おもう}（おもいます） “to think.”

/// This verb is used to express the speaker’s own thought; it is not used when the topic is in the third person.

/// When questioning the addressee directly for his or her opinion, the second person may be used in the topic position.

<br>

私はこの寿司は美味しいと思います。//I think that this sushi is delicious.

<br>

### (2) Types of onomatopoeia

/// Besides the onomatopoeia that originate in imitation of actual sounds, there are also other types of onomatopoeia in Japanese: e.g., onomatopoeia of manner and description, which mimic the manner of some activity or the quality of something.

<br>

### (3) The use of hiragana and katakana for onomatopoeia

/// While it is common to use katakana for sound onomatopoeia, onomatopoeia of manner and description are often written in hiragana, like the word きちん “properly” (manner)

/// The rules governing the use of katakana and hiragana for sound, manner, and descriptive onomatopoeia are not rigid, however. Variations in the use of these two kana in expressing onomatopoeia in writing may be observed.

<br>

/// The quotative particle と is necessary when the onomatopoeic word has no repeated elements.

<br>

あの人はいつもきちんと話します。//He always speaks properly.

この服はぼろぼろです。//This outfit is very old.

<br>

あのボロボロの服は私のです。//That old outfit is mine.

あの人はいつもピカピカの車を運転します。//That person always drives a shiny car.

<br>

#### Descriptive onomatopoeia with する（します）

/// Descriptive verbs may be created by adding する（します） to onomatopoeia.

/// どきどきする “to be nervous” （どきどき is the sound of someone’s heart pounding）

/// わくわくする “to be excited” （わくわく describes the feeling of being excited）

/// おろおろする “to be confused, be lost” （おろおろ describes the feeling of being lost）

/// In any language, there are innumerable ways to express an event.

/// The two broad categories are person-focused expressions and situation-focused expressions.

/// In person-focused expressions, “who will do/does/did something” is explicitly stated.

/// In situation-focused expressions, by contrast, the event is expressed without explicitly indicating “who will do/does/did something.” 

/// For instance, if someone spills some milk, the person-focused expression would be “I spilled the milk” while the situation-focused expression might be “The milk spilled.”

<br>

/// Within the context of Japanese culture, in some cases it is preferable to use situation-focused expressions because they are more indirect than person-focused expressions.

<br>

/// する（します） for the person-focused and なる（なります） for the situation-focused.

<br>

### (2) The verb する（します）

#### する（します） for making a choice or decision

<br>

#### Asking “how old are you?”

/// To ask someone’s age, either 何才 {なんさい} or いくつ may be used, but いくつ is normally used for asking children their age.

## 1: Subject が

### (1) The subject and its use

/// The topic is described in the comment.

/// The subject is described in the predicate.

<br>

#### The subject particle が

/// a clausal conjunction;

/// the marker for the topic when it is being questioned;

/// the marker for the direct object of the semi-transitive predicate;

/// the marker for the subject.

<br>

### (2) Adverb position

/// When adverbs are used in structures like those above, the natural place to use them is before the comment, rather than immediately before the predicate.

/// This is because the comment, rather than the predicate alone, comprises a complete entity.

<br>

エイミーさんはとても頭がいいです。//Amy-san is very smart.

エイミーさんは頭がとてもいいです。//Amy-san is very smart.

<br>

/// When adverbs are used in structures like those above, the natural place to use them is before the comment, rather than immediately before the predicate.

ナースロボさんは目が大きいです。//Naasurobo-san has large eyes.

/// the predicate 大きい {おおきい} describes the subject, 目 {め} “eyes,” rather than the topic. 

<br>

ナースロボさんは自分の目が嫌いです。//Naasurobo-san doesn’t like her [own] eyes.

<br>

/// the predicate 嫌い {きらい} “to dislike” is semi-transitive. That is, what the topic dislikes is the object, 目 {め} “eyes.”

<br>

### (2) Direct objects of adjectives and adjectival nouns

/// Some adjectives and adjectival nouns are classified as semi-transitive predicates, because they require a direct object for the notion to be complete.

/// As is the case with all semi-transitive predicates, the objects of these adjectives and adjectival nouns are marked by が.

<br>

/// examples show cases where these words modify nouns:

/// 好きな本 上手な人 欲しい本 怖い先生

<br>

/// 好き {すき} “to be fond of” and 嫌い {きらい} “to dislike” can be modified by the adverbial prefix 大, which means “big” and is pronounced だい (on-reading).

/// This prefix may not be used for all other adjectives or adjectival nouns. Its use is quite limited.

<br>

私は寿司が大好きです。//I love sushi.

私は寿司が大嫌いです。//I can’t stand sushi.

<br>

/// Even though the words 嫌い and 下手 {へた} carry a negative meaning, they may not be used with the adverb あまり because the structures in which they are used are positive.

/// To convey the intended meaning above, use the following sentence:

<br>

私はこの本があまり好きではありません。//I don’t like this book very much.

<br>

### (3) Emotive words

/// Words such as 欲しい {ほしい} and 怖い {こわい}, known as emotive words, express the speaker’s emotional state.

/// Such words are only used in the predicate when the speaker is the topic, or when directly questioning the addressee.

/// They may not be used to describe a third person’s emotional state.

<br>

私は犬が怖いです。//I am afraid of dogs.

あなたは何が怖いですか。//What are you afraid of?

<br>

/// This does not mean that the speaker can never describe a third person’s emotional state.

/// There are other structures to express this. One way is to report what the third person has said.

<br>

メアリーさんは犬が怖いと言いました。//Mary-san said that she (or he) is afraid of dogs.

<br>

/// Another way is for the speaker to report his or her own inference based on direct observation by adding ようだ（です） to the perceived emotion of the third person. 

<br>

メアリーさんは犬が怖いようです。//It looks to me like Mary-san is afraid of dogs.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Making Verbs into Nouns

/// In these structures the objects are nouns

<br>

あの学生は日本語が上手です。//That student is good at Japanese.

私はすしが欲しいです。//I want some sushi.

<br>

/// Because the element before a particle must be in a nominal form, using a verb alone in the object position would not make an acceptable sentence.

<br>

### (1) Nominalizing verbs with こと

/// The following example shows that adding こと immediately after the plain form of the verb changes the verb to a nominal form.

<br>

あの学生は日本語を話すことが上手です。//That student is good at speaking Japanese.

<br>

/// There are two things to remember for now about nominalizing verbs in general.

/// First of all, verbs that are used in the middle rather than the end of a sentence are normally in the plain form.

/// Second, こと must be used immediately after the verb to give this verb a nominal function.

/// こと here has no meaning except its grammatical function of turning a verb into a nominal form.

/// の instead of こと is also possible, although they are not completely interchangeable.

<br>

### (2) Expressing a desire to do things

/// -> [v-stem + たい]

/// The adjective 欲しい {ほしい} is used to express the speaker’s desire for a thing.

<br>

私は寿司が欲しいです。//I want some sushi.

<br>

/// 欲しい can take a noun, but not a verb (even a nominalized verb), as its object in a sentence.

/// Instead, the following structure must be used:

<br>

私は寿司が食べたいです。//I want to eat some sushi.

<br>

/// 食べたい in the above sentence is a derived adjective which expresses that the speaker wants to eat something.

/// To derive this type of adjective, drop ~ます from the polite form of the verb and add ~たい (e.g. たべます to たべたい).

/// The derived form expresses the speaker’s desire to do something. The newly derived form is an adjective, and is therefore conjugated as an adjective:

<br>

私は寿司が食べたくありません。//I don’t want to eat sushi.

私は寿司が食べたかったです。//I wanted to eat sushi.

私は寿司が食べたくありませんでした。//I did not want to eat sushi.

<br>

/// Like 欲しい, this predicate may be used to express the speaker’s desire to do something, as well as to ask another person directly about his or her desire, but it may not be used to express desire on the part of a third person.

<br>

あなたは何が食べたいですか。//What do you want to eat?

<br>

/// The following structures may be used to express the third-person’s desire:

<br>

メアリーさんは寿司が食べたいと言いました。//Mary-san said that she wants to eat sushi.

メアリーさんは寿司が食べたいようです。//It looks to me like Mary-san wants to eat sushi.

<br>

### (3) Expressing the speaker’s plan

/// -> [(v plain form) + つもり]

/// to express the speaker’s plan or to ask directly about the addressee’s plan.

/// This structure may not be used to talk about a third person’s plan.

<br>

メアリーさんは明日、何をするつもりですが。//What do you plan to do tomorrow, Mary-san?

家に帰るつもりです。//I plan to go home.

<br>

/// For the third person’s plan, the following structure may be used.

<br>

メアリーさんは家に帰るつもりだと言いました。//Mary-san said that she plans to go home.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: は and が

/// It is important for learners to understand the differences in how these two particles are used as clearly as possible.

/// the comparison between は and が is made only for the subject が and the topic は. 

<br>

### (1) The topic は

#### The speaker may signal what she or he wants to talk about by bringing it into the topic position, marked by は.

/// Just about anything can be brought to the topic position of a sentence.

<br>

#### When the speaker brings the topic into the sentence,

/// the assumption is that the speaker knows that the audience or addressee understands the referent of the topic.

<br>

#### What the speaker wants to convey to the audience or the addressee is the content described in the comment.

/// In other words, the comment is the new information, and the topic is the information in the sentence that is understood.

<br>

### (2) The subject が

#### In some expressions, the subject and the predicate together constitute a complete unit, called a comment.

/// In these structures, the predicate describes the subject, not the topic.

/// The subject and the predicate together form a single entity, the comment, which describes the topic.

<br>

#### When the subject is used in a sentence,

/// the new information is the subject; the predicate is the given (known) information in the sentence.

/// In this context, in the question about the topic, as well as in the response (that is, when new information is asked for and provided) the noun phrase with が may be called the subject.

<br>

昨日、だれが授業に来ませんでしたか。//Who did not come to the class yesterday?

ずんだもんさんが来ませんでした。//Zundamon-san is the one who did not come.

<br>

### (3) Comparing sentences with the topic and the subject

<br>

日本語の先生はいつもちょうど九時に授業を始めます。//The Japanese teacher always begins the class exactly at 9:00.

<br>

/// The sentence above, using the transitive verb, conveys what the teacher does (the new information is in the comment).

<br>

授業が九時に始まりました。//The class began at 9:00.

<br>

/// The sentence above with the intransitive verb says what it was that began at 9:00 (the new information is the subject).

<br>

#### Other intransitive predicates

/// In fact, the difference noted above can occur with any type of predicate, not just with transitive-intransitive verb pairs.

<br>

ずんだもん先生は九時にいらっしゃいました。//Zundamon-sensei came here at 9:00.

ずんだもん先生がいらっしゃいました。//Zundamon-sensei was the one who came here.

<br>

/// It is common to use the subject が with any kind of intransitive verb, not just the intransitive form of a pair verb, especially when the verb is used with no other information provided.

<br>

雨が降っています。//It’s raining.

授業が始まりです。//The class will begin.

<br>

/// When asking for other information, such as the time when the class begins, the new information is in the predicate.

<br>

授業は何時に始まりますか。//What time will the class begin?

（授業は）九時に始まります。//It will begin at 9:00.

<br>

### (4) The topicalized subject

/// any element may be brought to the topic position and marked with the particle は. This includes the subject.

/// subjects are often topicalized both in speaking and in writing.

/// The following examples show how the subject is topicalized in a series of questions.

<br>

だれが来ましたか。//Who came?

先生がいらっしゃいました。//The teacher was the one who came.

先生はどこからいらっしゃいましたか。//Where did the teacher come from?

（先生は）京都からいらしゃいました。//The teacher came from Kyoto.

<br>

/// What this means is that:

#### Any subject may be topicalized;

#### Not all topics are derived from subjects.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Comparisons

### (1) Comparing two things

#### Reference particle より

/// The particle より indicates that the preceding noun is an item or person being compared to the topic:

<br>

アメリカは日本より大きいです。//America is bigger than Japan.

<br>

/// The adverb もっと may also be used in comparisons, although it is redundant.

/// It need not be included for the sentence to have a comparative meaning.

<br>

アメリカは日本よりもっと大きいです。//America is bigger than Japan.

<br>

/// Using もっと does not change the meaning of the sentence, but it may make the comparative meaning stronger.

<br>

#### Adverb ずっと

/// When the speaker needs to strongly emphasize the degree of the description in the predicate, as in “America is much bigger than Japan,” the adverb ずっと “far more” may be used.

<br>

アメリカは日本よりずっと大きいです。//America is much bigger than Japan.

<br>

/// ずっと and もっと are generally not used together.

<br>

#### Comparative question sentences

/// When asking a question about the two items, the two things to be compared should be listed before forming the question.

/// There are a few different ways to list the items to be compared.

/// アメリカと日本と（とは・で・とで・では・とでは）

<br>

/// The question sentence that follows the list includes the pronoun どちら, which is used only to mean “which of the two.”

/// This pronoun can refer to things, people, or events.

<br>

アメリカと日本と、どちらが大きいですか。//America and Japan, which of the two is big?

<br>

/// The noun 方 {ほう} “side” is often added with の after どちら when comparing two things.

<br>

アメリカと日本とでは、どちらの方が大きいですか。//America and Japan, which side is big?

<br>

#### Answering comparative questions

/// When answering a question about a comparison, it is best to use a structure that parallels the structure of the question.

/// In answering a question that compares two items, the use of 方 is required, although it is optional in the question sentence.

<br>

アメリカと中国とでは、どちら（の方）が大きいですか。//Which is bigger, America or China?

中国の方が大きいです。//China is bigger.

<br>

/// どちらも “both” may be used when the answer does not favor one over the other:

<br>

日本語と英語と、どちらの方が難しいですか。//Which is more difficult, Japanese or English?

どちらも難しいです。//They’re both difficult.

どちらも難しくありません。//Neither of them is difficult.

/// [Literally, “Both are not difficult”]

<br>

#### Comparative sentences with negative predicates

/// If a negative predicate is used in a statement that compares two things, the compared referent is marked by ほど rather than より, as in the following:

<br>

日本はアメリカほど大きくありません。//Japan is not as big as America.

<br>

/// In the above sentence, ほど literally means “degree.”

<br>

#### The experience particle に

/// The particle に has many functions, に is also used to refer to a person who directly experiences a certain feeling described in the predicate.

/// The contrastive は is often used with this に to indicate that this experience is limited to that person (i.e., the one indicated by に).

<br>

私にはカタカナは漢字よりもっと難しいです。//Katakana is more difficult for me than kanji.

あの人の話は私にはよく分かりません。//That person’s talk is quite incomprehensible to me.

<br>

### (2) Comparing more than two things

/// In comparing more than two things or people, the adverb 一番 {いちばん}is placed immediately before the descriptive word.

/// The particle で indicates the boundary of comparison.

<br>

この大学は日本で一番大きい大学です。//This university is the biggest one in Japan.

<br>

#### Forming and responding to a question comparing more than two items

/// When listing things at the beginning of a sentence, the following structures may be used:

<br>

これとそれとあれの中で、どれが一番、安いですか。//Out of this one, that one, and that one over there, which is the cheapest?

<br>

/// The list can be summarized with either ~の中で {なかで} or ~のうちで.

/// It is also possible to provide the category in which a comparison will be made.

/// In this case, the particle で alone or の中で  {なかで} is used:

<br>

飲み物（の中）で、何が一番美味しいですか。//Among all drinks, which is the most delicious?

お茶が一番、美味しいです。//Tea is the most delicious.

<br>

/// The interrogative pronoun in this construction varies depending on what it refers to (どれ, だれ, ど こ, なに, etc).

/// どちら cannot be used in this construction; it is used only when two items are being compared.

<br>

クラスでだれが一番、親切ですか。//Who is the nicest person in class?

アリスさんが一番、親切です。//Alice-san is the nicest.

<br>

/// Particles also vary, depending on what part of the sentence is being questioned:

<br>

友達で、だれに一番よく話しますか。//Which of your friends do you talk to most often?

時雨さんに一番よく話します。//I talk to Shigure-san most often.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Comparing

<br>

チャンさんは中国語も話せますね？　すごいですねえ。でも、日本語と中国語とどっちが難しいですか。//You can speak Chinese, too, right? Wow! But which is more difficult, Japanese or Chinese?

どっちも難しいですね。//They’re both difficult.

<br>

/// どっち is a colloquial spoken form of どちら.

<br>

### (2) Health talk

<br>

クリスさん、どうしましたか。//What’s wrong, Kurisu-san?

ちょっと、頭が痛いんです。//I have a bit of a headache.

それはいけませんね。お大事に。//Oh, dear, that’s too bad. Do take care.

<br>

/// どうしましたか is a fixed expression used for an equivalent expression in English, “What happened?” 

/// In Japanese, 何 {なん・なに} is used for a very specific thing, but for a vague or openended thing, どう is used.

<br>

/// ちょっと is a colloquial expression of 少し {すこし}, “a little.”

<br>

/// それはいけませんね expresses that the speaker feels badly about the addressee’s poor condition.

<br>

/// お大事に {おだいじに} expresses the speaker’s hope that the addressee will take care of him/herself, because the speaker knows the addressee is not feeling well.

<br>

### (3) When the speaker does not know the answer

<br>

あの背が高い人と低い人と、どちらが時雨さんですか。//Which of those people is Shigure-san, the tall one or the short one?

ええと・・・。さあ、僕にはよく分かりません。すみません。//Let’s see… Uh, it’s hard for me to tell. I’m sorry.

ああ、大丈夫ですよ。ナースロボさんに聞きますから。//Oh, that’s all right. Don’t worry, I’ll ask Naasurobo-san.

<br>

/// ええと is a vocalization that indicates that the speaker is trying to decide or recall what to say.

/// In this case, the speaker is trying to come up with the correct answer.

/// The first syllable of the word may be drawn out while the speaker tries to find the answer or something to say.

<br>

#### 大丈夫です

/// When used in a question as in 大丈夫ですか {だいじょうぶですか} “Are you all right?” the speaker asks if the addressee is all right (health, general circumstances, current state, etc.).

/// 大丈夫です {だいじょうぶです} may either be the response to this question (“I’m OK”), or an expression used by the speaker to ease the worry of the addressee (“That’s OK”).

<br>

#### スミスさんに聞きますから {スミスさんに きき ますから}

/// This is almost like giving a reason as an afterthought.

/// から is the conjunction used to give a reason, but the way it is used here is incomplete.

/// If this clause came before 大丈夫です, it would mean “Because I’ll ask Smith-san, I’ll be all right.”

/// Note that the polite form rather than the plain form is used before から. When using this structure as an afterthought, this is not uncommon.

# Stage 1-8 Plain Forms of Predicates

## 1: Different Speech Styles of Predicates

### (1) The goal of this section

/// In Japanese, verbs, adjectives, and the copula conjugate, and all predicates have both plain and polite forms.

/// Everything that can be expressed in the polite form can be expressed in the plain form and vice versa.

<br>

### (2) Polite forms

#### In speaking

/// Polite forms are used in formal situations such as classrooms, conferences, speeches, etc., in which the speaker judges it appropriate to maintain some kind of social or psychological distance between him/herself and the addressee(s).

/// These forms are also used to address people whom the speaker does not know well, even when the situation is not that formal.

<br>

#### In writing

/// The polite form is used in personal writing such as letters, postcards, or e-mail messages, although the plain form may also be used in these cases (see below). The polite form may be used in letters, etc. even when the writer knows the receiver of the mail quite well.

/// This may be because things such as letters and postcards put some distance between the two parties involved.

/// Novels or essays, which are normally written in an impersonal style by employing the plain form, may use the polite form in some cases.

/// The use of the polite form in such works conveys the sense that the author is talking directly to the readers (i.e., narratives).

<br>

### (3) Plain forms

#### In speaking

/// Plain forms are used in casual conversations: when speaking to one’s family members and close friends, for instance.

/// The use of the plain form indicates that there is little to no personal distance between the two parties involved.

/// In some cases, an individual who is in an authoritative position may use the plain forms to her or his subordinates. This is particularly true of male speakers.

<br>

#### In writing

/// The plain form is used in places where little to no personal relation is considered.

/// It can be used in impersonal writing such as newspapers, essays, journals, etc. E-mail messages, or at times letters and postcards, to close friends and family members are like talking, so the plain form may be used.

<br>

#### Structural requirement

/// Using the plain form in some structures may be grammatically required regardless of the speech style.

/// For instance, predicates used in the non-final position are normally in the plain form even when the speech is in the polite style.

<br>

彼は日本語を話すことが上手です。//He is good at speaking Japanese.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Preparation for Conjugating Plain Predicates

### (1) Base forms

/// All conjugations are based on certain predicate forms, which are termed base forms in this course.

/// Some—not all—base forms have the same form as the dictionary forms, but differ in purpose, as defined below:

<br>

/// - Plain forms: these forms have different aspectual forms.

<br>

/// - Dictionary forms: these forms are used to represent each predicate in dictionaries and citations.

/// They thus have no aspectual forms, as plain forms do. Derived forms cannot be dictionary forms.

<br>

/// - Base forms: these forms are the base for all predicate conjugations.

/// Like dictionary forms, base forms do not have aspectual forms.

/// But unlike dictionary forms, derived forms (potential, passive, causative, たい-forms, etc.) are the base form for further conjugations.

<br>

#### The copula

/// The base form of the copula is だ. The copula is needed for conjugations of all nominal predicates.

<br>

僕は一年生だ。//I am a freshman.

この部屋はきれいだ。//This room is clean.

<br>

#### Adjectives

/// Since adjectives conjugate (the last ~い being the element that goes through the changes), the copula is not needed for conjugation in the plain form.

/// The base form of an adjective is that adjective without the copula.

<br>

この本は高い。//This book is expensive.

<br>

/// Derived adjectives such as the たい-form (indicating the speaker’s desire) are also base forms.

<br>

日本に行きたい。//I want to go to Japan.

<br>

#### Verbs

/// Some base forms are the same as the dictionary forms, but not all base forms are dictionary forms.

/// For instance, some base forms are derived by adding or inserting suffixes;

/// these derived forms are the base forms for conjugations, but they are not dictionary forms.

<br>

私は毎日、日本語を話す。//I speak Japanese every day.

<br>

### (2) Verb grouping

/// Verbs are classified into three different groups according to the final syllable of the base form.

/// In order to be able to conjugate verbs in different aspects and forms, it is necessary to learn which of these groups a given verb belongs to.

<br>

/// There are far fewer rules than there are different derived forms.

/// Trying to learn conjugations by rote is highly inefficient and often leads to inaccuracy.

<br>

/// Group 1: The verbs in this group always end with る. The syllable immediately before る contains the vowels i or e.

/// Group 2: All verbs that end with a syllable other than る are in this group （く, ぐ, す, む, ぬ, ぶ, つ, う）

///          There are some verbs that end with る in this group. In this case the syllable immediately before る contains the vowels u, o, or a

///          There are a small number of verbs that end with る and contain the vowels i or e in the syllable before る (same as Group 1), but nevertheless are Group 2 verbs

/// Group 3: The two verbs する and くる and compound verbs with する and くる all belong to this group

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: たべる, みる, おきる, ねる

/// G2: かく, およぐ, はなす, よむ, しぬ, よぶ, まつ, かう

///     わかる, おこる, うる

///     かえる, はしる

/// G3: する, くる

<br>

#### Points to remember about verb grouping

/// There are no exceptions to Group 3. The verbs that contain する and くる are always in Group 3.

/// There are also no exceptions for verbs ending with a syllable other than る. These verbs are always in Group 2.

/// When verbs end with る and the syllable immediately before る contains the vowels u, o, or a, they are always in Group 2. There are no exceptions to this rule. For instance, the following verbs are in Group 2: わかる, おこる, うる

/// When a verb ends with る, and the syllable immediately before る contains the vowels i or e, then the verb is most likely in Group 1. For example, the following verbs belong to Group 1: たべる, みる, おしえる

/// There are a few verbs ending in る that belong to Group 2, even though the syllable immediately before る contains the vowels i or e. There is no system for determining which of these verbs are in Group 2. For instance, きる “to wear” is a Group 1 verb, while きる “to cut” belongs to Group 2.

<br>

/// In the same way, いる “to exist” is a Group 1 verb, but いる “to need” is a Group 2 verb. Because of these variations, the group number of each verb is given in the summary of the new vocabulary at the end of each chapter in the Workbooks from this chapter onward.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Plain Positive Imperfectives

/// The plain positive imperfective forms have the same form as the base forms.

/// This particular aspect of these forms is called the “positive imperfective form.”

<br>

#### Nominal predicates

/// Since nouns cannot change forms, the aspectual differentiation of the nominal predicate must rely on the conjugation of the copula.

/// For the nominal predicate, therefore, use the base form of the copula, which is だ, to indicate the positive imperfective aspect.

<br>

私は学生だ。//I am a student.

<br>

/// Use the same structure when an adjectival noun is used in the predicate.

<br>

この部屋は静かだ。//This room is quiet.

<br>

#### Adjectival predicates

/// While the copula だ in the nominal predicate is required for the plain positive imperfective aspect, it is not a necessary element in the adjectival predicate for this aspect.

/// Since adjectives do conjugate for aspects, adjectival predicates do not need to rely on the conjugation of the copula.

/// The copula in the adjectival predicate is necessary only for the polite form.

<br>

この本は大きい。//This book is big.

<br>

/// The predicate of the following sentence is a derived adjective.

<br>

寿司が食べたい。//I want to eat sushi.

<br>

/// When an adjective modifies a noun in the predicate, it belongs to the nominal predicate. だ, therefore, is necessary in this case.

<br>

これは大きい本だ。//This is a big book.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates

/// As mentioned above, the plain positive imperfective aspect of a verb in the predicate appears to be the same as the base form.

<br>

私は毎日テレビを見る。//I watch TV every day.

パクさんは明日、日本に行く。//Park-san will go to Japan tomorrow.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Plain Negative Imperfectives

#### Nominal predicates

/// -> [だ → ではない or じゃない]

/// The rule for changing the base form of the copula to the plain negative imperfective aspectual form is as follows. 

/// As in the polite form, the use of じゃ here is a little more colloquial than では.

<br>

僕は学生ではない。//I am not a student.

僕は学生じゃない。//I am not a student.

<br>

/// When an adjectival noun is used in the predicate, use the same structure.

<br>

これは大切じゃない。//This is not important.

<br>

#### Adjectival predicates

/// -> [~い → ~く ない]

/// To change the base form of an adjective to the plain negative imperfective aspectual form, use the following rule:

<br>

この本は高くない。//This book is not expensive.

この学生はあまりよくない。//This college is not very good.

<br>

/// See the following example with a derived adjective:

<br>

日本に行きたくない。//I don’t want to go to Japan.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates

/// The following are the rules for changing the base form of a verb to its plain negative imperfective aspectual form.

/// The verb group must first be identified before applying these rules.

<br>

/// Group 1: [る → ない]

/// Group 2: change the final vowel of the last syllable {u} to {a} and then add ない

///             Verbs that end with う belong to Group 2, the plain negative imperfective of a う-ending verb is as follows: かう → かわない; つかう → つかわない

/// Group 3: [くる → こない], [する → しない]

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: 食べない

/// G2: 書かない

/// G3: こない, しない

<br>

テレビは見ない。//I won’t watch TV.

お金を使わない。//I won’t use any money.

<br>

#### The verb ある

/// The verb ある has a somewhat modified conjugation.

/// Although ある is a Group 2 verb, its plain negative imperfective form is ない rather than あらない (the form that would result if ある followed the rule).

<br>

今、僕はお金がない。//I don’t have any money right now.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Plain Positive Perfectives

#### Nominal predicates

/// -> [だ → だった]

/// The following rule changes the base form of the copula into the plain positive perfective form:

<br>

私は学生だった。//I was a student.

あの車はきれいだった。//The car was clean.

<br>

#### Adjectival predicates

/// -> [~い → ~かった]

/// The following rule changes the base form of an adjective into the plain positive perfective form:

<br>

あの本は高かった。//That book was expensive.

あの映画はよかった。//That movie was good.

日本に行きたかった。//I wanted to go to Japan.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates

/// The plain positive perfective forms of verbs have more rules than most other forms.

/// However, since these same rules can be applied to other forms, it is very useful to learn them.

<br>

/// Group 1: [る → た]

/// Group 2: [く → いた], [ぐ → いだ], [す → した], [む, ぬ, ぶ → んだ], [つ, う, る → った]

/// Group 3: [する → した, くる → きた]

/// The only exception to the rule above is the verb 行く {いく}. Although this verb ends with く, the plain positive perfective form is 行った {いった}.

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: 食べた

/// G2: 書いた

///     泳いだ

///     話した

///     読んだ, 死んだ, 遊んだ

///     待った, 使った, 帰った

/// G3: した, きた

<br>

朝ご飯にパンを食べた。//I ate a piece of bread for breakfast.

ืื時雨さんと映画に行った。//I went to a movie with Shigure-san.

<br>

/// There is only one verb that ends with ぬ. That verb is 死ぬ {しぬ}, which means “to die.”

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 6: Plain Negative Perfectives

/// There is only one rule for this form; it applies to all predicate types.

<br>

/// First change the base form of the predicate to the plain negative imperfective form, which always ends in ない. 

/// Then change the final ~い to ~かった.

<br>

#### Nominal predicates

<br>

私は学生じゃなかった。//I wasn’t a student.

部屋はきれいじゃなかった。//The room was not clean.

<br>

#### Adjectival predicates

<br>

あの本は高くなかった。//That book wasn’t expensive.

あの本はよくなかった。//That book wasn’t good.

日本に行きたくなかった。//I didn’t want to go to Japan.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates

<br>

昨日はテレビを見なかった。//I didn’t watch TV yesterday.

去年、日本に行かなかった。//I didn’t go to Japan last year.

<br>

## 7: Plain Volitional Forms

/// sentences with the volitional copula express that something is highly probable.

<br>

#### Nominal predicates

/// -> [だ → だろう]

<br>

あの人は日本人だろう。//That person is probably Japanese.

あの人は親切だろう。//That person is probably kind.

<br>

#### Adjectival predicates (reference only)

/// -> [い → かろう]

/// The plain volitional forms of adjectives derived from base forms are not commonly used except for in some fixed expressions.

/// The plain volitional form of adjectives is nevertheless introduced here to make its existence known, but this form need not be practiced, at least for the time being.

<br>

/// 大きい 大きかろう, いい よかろう

<br>

#### Sentences with the plain volitional form of the copula

/// A sentence followed by the plain volitional form of the copula expresses the speaker’s inference of a high possibility:

<br>

この本は高いだろう。//This book is probably expensive.

ナースロボさんはアメリカ人じゃないだろう。//Naasurobo-san is probably not an American.

ナースロボさんは日本に行かなかっただろう。//Naasurobo-san probably did not go to Japan.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates

/// The plain volitional verb forms have other uses in addition to the meaning of “Let’s do such-and-such.”

/// All verbs therefore have the volitional forms, although in some cases the volitional forms may not be used for the meaning of “Let’s do such-and-such.”

<br>

/// Group 1: [る → よう]

/// Group 2: change the final vowel {u} to the double {o (oo)}

/// Group 3: [する → しよう], [くる→こよう]

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: 見よう

/// G2: 行こう

/// G3: しよう, こよう

<br>

テレビを見よう。//Let’s watch TV.

一緒に勉強しよう。//Let’s study together.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 8: Speech Levels

### (1) Politeness and honorifics

/// Knowing when to use honorifics is not as straightforward as one might imagine.

/// Some use of honorifics is socially expected from everyone, but in some cases, the speaker chooses to use honorifics simply to be polite regardless of the situation.

<br>

/// There are certain tendencies—and these are only tendencies—concerning the use of honorifics:

/// - Women tend to use honorifics more frequently than men;

/// - The use of honorifics, especially among young people, seems to be decreasing recently in daily life, although people are still expected to use them once they become adults or enter the workplace;

/// - Honorifics may sometimes be used solely for the purpose of politeness rather than to acknowledge the superior position of the topic; for example, when addressing a stranger.

<br>

/// The honorific system affects verbs most noticeably, but other parts of speech such as nouns, adjectives, and the copula are also affected.

<br>

/// Do not confuse politeness, 丁寧語 {ていねいご}, with honorifics, 敬語 {けいご}. They are related, but the following difference must be noted.

/// Politeness has to do with the relationship between the speaker and the addressee. The use of honorifics, on the other hand, has to do with the relationship between the speaker and the topic of the sentence.

<br>

/// The use of ~ます or です at the end of a sentence indicates the polite form.

/// The use of an honorific verb indicates the speaker’s respect towards the topic, which may or may not be the person the speaker is addressing.

/// Honorific verbs therefore have polite forms and plain forms.

<br>

/// The diagram below illustrates the relationship between the speaker and either the topic or the addressee.

/// いらっしゃ (for topic) る (for addressee)

/// いらっしゃい (for topic) ます (for addressee)

<br>

先生は今日は研究室にいらっしゃる。//The teacher is in her office today.

先生は今日は研究室にいらっしゃいます。//The teacher is in her office today.

<br>

#### Talking with and about family members

/// When a speaker talks to a close friend or a family member, the plain form should be used.

/// All family members are considered to be うち-group, so neither the polite form nor honorifics are used when talking to them or about them.

<br>

### (2) Different politeness degrees of negative predicates

/// There are two ways to make negatives polite. The first way is to use the polite negatives, as follows:

<br>

私はずんだもんではありません。//I am not Zundamon.

この本はよくありません。//This book is not good.

私はお金がありません。//I don’t have money.

<br>

/// The second way to make negatives polite is simply to add です to the plain negative form.

/// Since this negative form is less formal than the polite form, it is called the casual-polite form. See the following examples:

<br>

私はずんだまんじゃないです。//I am not Zundamon.

この本はよくないです。//This book is not good.

私はお金がないです。//I don’t have money.

<br>

/// The degrees of politeness of these negative forms are as follows (in order from most to least polite):

/// Nominal predicate: ではありません > じゃありません > ではないです > じゃないです

/// Adjectival predicate: よくありません > よくないです

/// Verbal predicate: ありません > ないです

<br>

/// ~ないです is not used as often for verbal predicates as it is for nominal and adjectival predicates.

/// However, the use of ないです to mean “I don’t have” (as in 私はお金がないです) is more frequent than the use of ~ないです with other verbs

<br>

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Casual speech: asking a question and responding

<br>

寿司、好き？//You like sushi?

うん、もちろん、大好き。//Yeah, of course, I love it.

<br>

#### Particle deletion in casual speech

/// Particles are often deleted in conversation, but they are deleted even more frequently in casual speech.

/// Particles such as the topic は, the subject が, the object が, and the object を are deleted much more often than others such as に, で, and から.

<br>

#### Question sentences: absence of the copula and the question particle

/// For both female and male speakers, the use of the copula or the question particle か is not necessary in question sentences.

<br>

/// うん or ん is a very casual way to indicate agreement.

/// You may not even hear the first う in some cases. You may hear only the sound ん.

/// The actual sound is difficult to describe, so it is important to hear a native speaker say it, either personally or via sound files.

<br>

/// もちろん is a conversational word that means “of course.”

<br>

### (2) Female and male casual conversation

/// In casual speaking, the differences between male and female speakers surface more prominently than in formal conversation. Such differences are usually in word choice, sentence-final particles, and the use of the copula.

<br>

この鞄、随分、高いわねえ。//This bag is pretty expensive, isn’t it?

本当に高いねえ。これ、どこの鞄？//It sure is. Where was it made?

アメリカのじゃない？//Isn’t it American?

うん、そうだよ。アメリカのだよ。//Yeah, you’re right. It’s American.

<br>

#### The sentence-final particle わ

/// The sentence-final particle わ is used only in conversation by female speakers.

/// This particle conveys that the assertion of the speaker is a new discovery.

/// In the case of a nominal predicate, だ must be used with わ.

<br>

あの人は先生だわ。//That person is the teacher.

この本は本当に難しいわ。//This book is really difficult.

明日、行くわ。//I want to tell you that I will be going tomorrow.

<br>

/// じゃない？ at the end of a sentence indicates that the speaker is fairly sure, but not 100% certain, that the information is correct.

/// Therefore, じゃない is used to obtain a confirmation from the listener. A rising intonation should be used.

<br>

#### Presence of だ

/// だ is used after a nominal predicate when another particle is present (よ in this case).

/// The use of だ in the last line indicates that the speaker is a male.

/// A female speaker would normally not use だ if it is the last element of a sentence (e.g. そうだ).

/// A female speaker uses だ followed by a particle, as in そうだわ.

<br>

チャンさん、これ、食べない？//Chang-san, won’t you eat this?

ううん。今は要らないよ。//No, thanks. I don’t want it right now.

これは？//How about this?

それも要らないよ。//I don’t want that, either.

<br>

### (3) Responses by female speakers

<br>

クリスさん、これ、食べない？//Kurisu-san, won’t you eat this?

ううん。今は要らないわ。//No, thanks. I don’t want it right now.

これは？//How about this?

それも要らないわ。//I don’t want that, either.

<br>

/// ううん is a very casual way of saying “No.” It is often accompanied by a quick side-to-side head movement.

/// This response is especially difficult to transcribe, so it is important for the learner to hear native speakers (like those in the sound files) utter this response and not to depend on the written representation alone.

/// Imitating the native speaker’s intonation of this response is important.

<br>

### (4) Urging the other

<br>

さあ、行こうか。//OK. Shall we go now?

今？　一時行かない？//Now? How about at 1:00?

一時？　いいよ。//1:00? All right.

<br>

/// さあ here indicates that the speaker is suggesting, or even urging, the addressee to do a certain thing, “going” in the above case, at the time of the speech.

/// さあ, in this case, must be pronounced with a short falling tone.

/// さあ spoken with a longer rising tone is used while trying to think of an answer (one which the speaker probably does not know)stage １，９。

# Stage 1-9 Bridging Stage 1 and Stage 2

## 1: When to Use Plain Forms

### (1) Plain forms in the final and non-final positions

#### Final positions

/// Plain forms are used for different functions.

/// In speaking, they are used in the final position of a sentence to indicate that the speaker and the addressee are in a close relationship (e.g., close friends, family members).

<br>

/// When plain forms are used in the final position of a sentence in writing, it indicates that the writing is impersonal.

/// That is, the writer is not addressing any particular individual (e.g., newspaper articles, essays).

<br>

#### Non-final positions

/// For predicates in the non-final position of a sentence, the plain predicate is used in most cases, regardless of the speech (or writing) style.

<br>

### (2) Examples of predicates in the non-final position

#### Nominalizing verbs

/// when a verb is used in a non-final position, such as the topic or object position of a sentence, it must be in the plain form with the functional noun こと (this noun is therefore called a nominalizer).

<br>

私は日本語が好きです。//I like the Japanese language.

私は日本語ができます。//I have some ability in Japanese.

日本語は易しいです。//Japanese is easy.

<br>

私は日本語を話すことが好きです。//I like to speak Japanese.

私は日本語を話すことができます。//I can speak Japanese.

日本語を話すことは易しいです。//Speaking Japanese is easy.

<br>

/// the verb 話す {はなす} is used in a non-final position in the same sentences.

/// こと follows the verb 話す to nominalize it

<br>

#### Reporting what others have said

/// When reporting what others have said, the verb 言う {いう} “to say” is used.

/// The particle と connects the content of the quote and the final verb, 言う.

/// If it is not a direct quote, the content of the quote should be expressed in the plain form.

/// The following examples illustrate the different predicate types and aspectual forms used in the content of the quote.

<br>

時雨さんは日本語が好きだと言いました。//Shigure-san said that she likes the Japanese language.

時雨さんは日本語は易しくないと言いました。//Shigure-san said that Japanese isn’t easy.

時雨さんは日本語ができたと言いました。//Shigure-san said that he once was able to speak Japanese.

<br>

/// To ask what another person said, use the following structure:

<br>

時雨さんは何と言いましたか。//What did Shigure-san say?

<br>

#### Conveying the speaker’s thought

/// the speaker’s opinion can be conveyed by the verb 思う {おもう} “to think.”

/// The content of the speaker’s thought must be in the plain form.

/// Remember that this verb, 思う “to think,” is used by the speaker only to express his or her own thoughts or to ask another person directly about their opinion.

/// 思う may not be used to express a third person’s thoughts.

/// Because of this, even when the first-person pronoun is not used in the topic position, it should be understood that the topic of the sentence is the speaker.

<br>

私はあの人は日本人だと思います。//I think that that person is Japanese.

日本語は易しいと思います。//I think that Japanese is easy.

ずんだまんさんは明日、日本に行くと思います。//I think that Zundamon-san will go to Japan tomorrow.

<br>

/// To ask for an opinion, どう is used rather than 何.

/// どう is normally used for general information while 何 {なに・なん} is used for specific information. Compare the following two question sentences:

<br>

ずんだもんさんは日本語についてどう思いますか。//What do you think of Japanese, Zundamon-san?

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

#### Hearing

/// The verb 聞く {きく} has two meanings, “to hear” (or “to listen”) and “to ask.”

/// When discussing something he or she heard, the speaker can report the content in the plain form.

<br>

私はあの人は日本人だと聞きました。//I heard that that person is Japanese.

ずんだまんさんは昨日、日本に行かなかったと聞きました。//I heard that Zundamon-san didn’t go to Japan yesterday.

<br>

/// To ask about what the addressee has heard, どんなこと is used. In this case, the particle を is used, but not と.

<br>

あなたはどんなことを聞きましたか。//What did you hear?

<br>

/// When asking the exact content of what the addressee has heard, 何 {なん} is used. Here, too, を, not と, is used:

<br>

あなたはずんだまんさんに何を聞きましたか。//What did you hear from Zundamon-san?

あなたはずんだまんさんから何を聞きましたか。//What did you hear from Zundamon-san?

<br>

/// In responding to the two questions above, と is placed between the content and the verb 聞く {きく}.

<br>

日本語の試験は易しかったと聞きました。//I heard that the Japanese examination was easy.

<br>

#### Asking

/// When reporting what one has asked others, the reported content must be in the form of a question sentence ending in the particle か.

/// In this case, the use of the particle と between the content of the question and the final verb 聞く {きく} becomes unnecessary.

<br>

私はルームメートに日本語の試験は易しかったか聞きました。//I asked my roommate if the Japanese examination was easy.

私はずんだまんさんに明日、日本に行くか聞きました。//I asked Zundamon-san if she would go to Japan tomorrow.

<br>

/// The copula should not be used after the noun in the nominal predicate of the question clause:

<br>

私はずんだまんさんにあの人は日本人か聞きました。//I asked Zundamon-san whether that person is Japanese.

<br>

/// Sentences with and without と differ slightly in meaning when reporting questions. 

/// When と is used, the sentence reports how the question was posed.

<br>

/// To ask exactly what question was posed to another person, use 何 {なん}.

/// In this case, the particle と is used after 何 {なん}

<br>

あなたはずんだもんさんに何と聞きましたか。//How did you ask Zundamon-san?

私はずんだもんさんに日本語の試験は易しかったかと聞きました。//I asked Zundamon-san, ‘Was the Japanese exam easy?’

<br>

/// To ask for the content of what the addressee asked, use どんなこと.

/// In this case, the particle を is used for どんなこと

<br>

あなたはどんなことを聞きましたか。//What kinds of things did you ask?

日本について聞きました。//I asked him about Japan.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Complex Structures

### (1) About complex sentences

/// A sentence that contains only one predicate is called a simple sentence.

/// A complex sentence consists of at least two clauses.

/// These two clauses form a relationship, with one being the independent clause (also called the main clause) and the other being the dependent clause (or subordinate clause).

<br>

/// An independent (main) clause is one that would function as a complete sentence even if the dependent (subordinate) clause were not joined to it.

/// Unlike independent clauses, dependent clauses cannot be used in isolation. They depend on the presence of independent clauses to complete their meaning.

<br>

/// The function of a dependent clause is similar to that of an adjective or adverb, though on the level of a clause rather than a word or a phrase.

/// Therefore, dependent clauses are classified either as adverbial or adjectival clauses.

<br>

### (2) Adjectival clauses

/// A noun or noun phrase may be modified by an adjective, an adjectival noun, or a noun, as explained earlier.

/// A noun (phrase) can also be modified by a clause.

/// the element modifying a noun (phrase) is always placed before the noun (phrase) that it modifies.

<br>

/// A clause that modifies a noun or noun phrase is called an adjectival clause because of its function.

<br>

#### Two topics in one sentence

/// A sentence that contains an adjectival or an adverbial clause consists of at least two clauses, one of them dependent and the other independent.

/// Each of these clauses may have the same topic (subject, in the case of English) or a different one.

<br>

/// when the dependent and independent clauses have different topics, が is used for the topic of the dependent clause and は for the topic of the independent clause.

/// When the topics are identical, は is used once, and the topic is not repeated.

<br>

/// No particle is needed between the verb in the adjectival clause and the noun it modifies.

<br>

私は昨日、買った本を読みました。//I read the book that I bought yesterday.

私は昨日、ずんだもんさんが買った本を読みました。//I read the book that Zundamon-san bought yesterday.

<br>

### (3) Adverbial clauses joined by から

<br>

昨日、私は病気でした。だから、授業を休みました。//I was sick yesterday. Therefore, I didn’t go to class.

<br>

/// These two separate sentences can be joined into a single sentence that consists of a dependent clause and an independent clause.

/// The function of this dependent clause is adverbial, because it gives the reason for the independent clause; it is therefore an adverbial clause.

/// The predicate in an adverbial clause is normally in the plain form.

/// The two clauses are joined by the clausal conjunction から.

<br>

昨日、私は病気だったから、授業を休みました。//Because I was sick yesterday, I didn’t go to class.

<br>

/// When two clauses are joined by the conjunction から, the first clause always indicates the reason for the consequence expressed in the main clause.

<br>

/// The adverbial clause must come before the independent clause, just as an adverb must be used before the word it modifies.

/// Reversing the order of the two clauses is unacceptable in Japanese.

<br>

/// the interrogative pronouns どうして and なぜ may be used to ask the reasons for certain consequences.

/// When used in this way, なぜ is more formal than どうして. Very colloquially, なんで may be used as well.

/// Since these interrogative pronouns have an adverbial function, no particle is necessary.

/// Although the interrogative pronouns in the examples below are in the sentence-initial position, they may be used anywhere in the sentence except at the end.

<br>

どうして、あなたは昨日、授業を休みましたか。//Why were you absent from class yesterday?

なぜ、あなたは昨日、授業を休みましたか。//Why were you absent from class yesterday?

なんで、あなたは昨日、授業を休みましたか。//Why were you absent from class yesterday?

<br>

私は病気だったから、授業を休みました。//I was sick yesterday, so I didn’t go to class.

<br>

/// As in sentences with adjectival clauses, when the two clauses have different topics, the topic in the adverbial clause is marked by が.

/// The main topic marked by は may be used in the sentence-initial position, or after the conjunction から:

<br>

昨日、私は、子供が病気だったから、授業を休みました。//My child was sick, so I didn’t go to class yesterday.

<br>

#### Clauses in conversation

/// In responding to a question in actual conversation, the main clause is often deleted since it would be a repetition of the question.

/// です in the second response abbreviates the entire independent clause.

<br>

どうして、昨日、授業を休みましたか。//Why were you absent from class yesterday?

子供が病気だったからです。//Because my child was sick.

<br>

#### In a more polite situation

/// In a very polite situation, it is not incorrect to use the polite form of the predicate in the adverbial clause.

/// However, this would be too polite for normal conversation.

<br>

昨日、私は、子供が病気でしたから、授業を休みました。//I didn’t come to class yesterday because my child was sick.

<br>

### (4) Adverbial clauses joined by 時 {とき}, 前に {まえに}, and 後で {あとで}

<br>

昨日、私は雪ノ下さんに会いました。その時に、私は留学について話しました。//I met Yukinoshita-san yesterday. At that time, I told him about my study-abroad.

昨日、私は雪ノ下さんに会いました。その前に、私はお茶を買いました。//I met Yukinoshita-san yesterday. Before that, I bought tea.

私は雪ノ下さんに会いました。そのあとで、先生にメールを書きました。//I met Yukinoshita-san. After that, I wrote an e-mail message to my teacher.

<br>

/// The sentences joined by each conjunction above may be changed into complex sentences by using 時, 前に, and 後で as clausal conjunctions.

/// The use of particle に after the conjunction 時 is optional.

<br>

私は雪ノ下さんに会った時に、留学について話しました。//When I ran into Yukinoshita-san, I told him about my study-abroad.

<br>

/// Before the conjunction 前に, the verb must always be in the imperfective form, regardless of the aspect of the main clause.

<br>

私は雪ノ下さんに会う前に、お茶を買いました。//I bought tea before I met Yukinoshita-san.

私は雪ノ下さんに会う前に、お茶を買います。//I will buy tea before I meet Yukinoshita-san.

<br>

/// Before the conjunction 後で, the verb must always be in the perfective form, regardless of the aspect of the main clause.

<br>

私は雪ノ下さんに会った後で、先生にメールを書きました。//After I met Yukinoshita-san, I wrote an e-mail message to my teacher.

私は雪ノ下さんに会った後で、先生にメールを書きます。//After I meet Yukinoshita-san, I will write an e-mail message to my teacher.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Complex Predicates

### (1) What are complex predicates?

/// One of the defining features of Japanese sentence structure is the use of the complex predicate to express the speaker’s intention, view, etc. by adding another element to the existing predicate.

/// Properly used, complex predicates add important nuance to sentences and discourses.

/// As noted, adding ~んだ to a statement sentence indicates that the sentence explains either a previously mentioned sentence or one that will follow.

/// And adding ~んだ to a question sentence changes the nuance to indicate that the speaker wants to confirm a certain assertion or inference with the addressee.

<br>

/// adding ~ようだ to an existing predicate indicates that the idea in that predicate is the speaker’s inference drawn from his or her observations.

<br>

### (2) つもりだ

/// adding the functional noun つもりだ to the existing predicate expresses the speaker’s intent.

/// つもりだ may only be used to express the intent of the speaker or that of an addressee if used as a direct question.

/// つもりだ may not be used in the complex predicate to express a third person’s intention.

<br>

チャンさんは明日、何をするつもりですか。宿題をするつもりですか。//What are you planning to do tomorrow, Chang-san? Are you going to do your homework?

宿題はしないつもりですが、買い物に行くつもりです。//I’m not planning to do my homework, but I’m going to go shopping.

<br>

/// One way to ask about or state a third person’s intention is to use the verb 思う {おもう}.

<br>

時雨さんは明日、何をすると思いますか。//What do you think Shigure-san will do tomorrow?

宿題をすると思います。//I think he’ll do his homework.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) だろう

/// the volitional form of the copula is used to express the speaker’s view that the content preceding だろう （でしょう） is likely to be true.

/// The following examples are with the verbal, adjectival, and nominal predicates, in that order.

/// Aspectual differences are expressed in the predicate before だろう.

<br>

チャンさんは日本語が多分、上手に話せたでしょう。//Chang-san could probably speak Japanese well.

来年の日本語の授業は易しくないでしょう。//Next year’s Japanese class will probably be not easy.

<br>

/// When だろう（でしょう） is used following a nominal predicate, the copula だ is not used:

<br>

多分、あの学生は三年生でしょう。//That student is probably a third grader.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) かもしれない

/// Complex predicates with かもしれない （かもしれません） convey less certainty than those using だろう.

/// For sentences with かもしれない, the adverb もしかしたら “by chance” may be used, although it is optional.

/// As with だろう （でしょう）, the nominal predicate should not be accompanied by だ.

/// Aspectual differences are expressed in the predicate before かもしれない.

<br>

あの学生はもしかしたら、三年生かもしれません。//Perhaps that student is a third grader.

もしかしたら、チャンさんは日本語が上手に話せないかもしれません。//Chang-san may not be able to speak Japanese well.

去年の日本語の授業はもっと易しかったかもしれません。//The Japanese class last year might have been easier.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: New Forms

### (1) Conjunctive forms

/// The conjunctive form, also called the て-form because of its ending, has been used from early on in this course, although the rules for its use were not explained in detail.

/// The rules governing the conjunctive form are exactly the same as those for the plain positive perfective form, except for the last syllable:

///      instead of ending the form with た or だ, as in the plain positive perfective, the ending should be て or で.

<br>

#### Copula

/// [だ → で]

/// - Ex 先生だ → 先生で

<br>

#### Adjective

/// [い → くて]

/// - Ex たかい → たかくて

<br>

#### Verb

/// Group 1: [る → て]

/// Group 2: [く → いて],

///          [ぐ → いで],

///          [す → して],

///          [む,ぬ,ぶ → んで],

///          [つ,う,る → って],

///          Exception [いく → いって]

/// Group 3: [する → して], [くる → きて]

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: たべる → たべて

/// G2: かく → かいて

///     およぐ → およいで

///     はなす → はなして

///     よむ → よんで, しぬ → しんで, あそぶ → あそんで

///     まつ → まって, かう → かって, かえる → かえって

<br>

/// *Negative [~ない → ~なくて], [Vない → Vないで]

/// -Ex 先生じゃなくて, よくなくて, たべなくて

///     たべないで

<br>

/// The negative imperfectives of predicates, all of which end with ない, are formed in the same way as adjectives.

/// Verbs have two different negative conjunctive forms.

<br>

/// The conjunctive form is used with various elements; each combination has its own meaning.

/// The following summarizes the combinations that have already been introduced in the earlier chapters.

<br>

#### Use of the conjunctive form 1

/// Because the conjunction と may not be used to join predicates, the conjunctive form of the predicate is used instead.

/// The following examples illustrate the use of the conjunctive form in nominal, adjectival, and verbal predicates, in that order.

<br>

私はこの大学の学生で、二年生です。//I am a student at this college and a sophomore.

このコンピュータは安くて、とてもいいです。//This computer is cheap and also very good.

私は朝、早く起きて、宿題をしました。//I got up early in the morning and did my homework.

<br>

#### Use of the conjunctive form 2

/// A construction consisting of the conjunctive form and いる is used to express a continuous aspect of the predicate.

<br>

今学期、日本語を勉強しています。//I’m studying Japanese this semester.

/// or “I’m studying Japanese this semester.”

<br>

#### Use of the conjunctive form 3

/// The conjunctive form can be combined with ください to express a polite command and request.

<br>

明日の朝、九時にここに来てください。//Please come here at 9:00 tomorrow morning.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Stems

/// Stems are used with many different words, particles, or suffixes to express various things.

<br>

/// to derive the stem of a verb from its base form:

/// Group 1: Drop る from the base form.

/// Group 2: Change the vowel of the last syllable, {u}, to the vowel {i}.

/// Group 3: Drop る and change the vowel {u} of the remaining syllable to the vowel {i}.

///          [する → し], [くる → き]

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: たべる → たべ

/// G2: かく → かき

/// G3: する → し, くる → き

<br>

#### Use of the stem 1

/// -> [stem + ます]

/// The polite form of a verb is created by combining the stem and the suffix ~ます.

<br>

#### Use of the stem 2

/// -> [stem + たい]

/// When the stem is joined with the suffix ~たい, the combined form is an adjective that expresses the speaker’s desire.

/// Like the complex predicate with つもりだ, the newly formed adjective can be used only to express the speaker’s own desire or to ask another person directly about their desire.

/// It may not be used to express a third-person’s desire.

<br>

明日、どこに行きたいですか。町に行きたいですか。//Where do you want to go? Would you like to go to town?

町には行きたくありませんが、図書館に行きたいです。//I don’t want to go to town; I want to go to the library.

<br>

/// Since this form is an adjective, it follows the rules for conjugating adjectives:

/// the negative imperfective is 行きたくありません “I don’t want to go”;

/// the positive perfective is 行きたかったです “I wanted to go”;

/// and the negative perfective is 行きたくありませんでした “I did not want to go.”

<br>

#### Use of the stem 3

/// -> [stem + に]

/// The stem and the particle に can be combined to express the topic’s purpose for going somewhere to do something.

/// This construction is used as an adverbial phrase.

<br>

/// This structure may only be used if the final verb indicates direction (i.e. going, coming here, going home, etc.).

/// When the final verb is not a verb of movement, this construction may not be used.

<br>

私達はあの町に寿司を食べに行きました。//We went to that town to eat sushi.

新聞を読みに図書館に行きました。//I went to the library to read the newspaper.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Derived Verbs

### (1) About derived verbs

/// These derived verbs, which are further used as the base forms for aspectual conjugations, include potential, passive, and causative verbs.

/// they function as independent verbs.

<br>

### (2) Potential verbs

/// Verbs that express the ability of the topic to do something have been introduced as independent words up until this point.

/// These include 話せる {はなせる} “to be able to speak,” 書ける {かける} “to be able to write,” and 読める {よめる} “to be able to read.”

/// In addition to indicating ability, potential verbs also express possibility.

/// Their active counterparts are 話す {はなす} “to speak,” 書く {かく} “to write,” and 読む  {よむ} “to read.”

<br>

/// In English, a potential expression consists of the auxiliary verb “can” or “be able to” and a verb such as “speak,” as in “I can speak Japanese” or “I am able to speak Japanese.”

<br>

/// In Japanese, instead of being formed by adding an element to a verb, the potential verb (also called the potential form of a verb) is derived from the base verb.

/// The rules for forming potential verbs were not introduced along with the verbs above.

/// Of course, knowing how to derive potential verbs from the base forms is much more efficient than trying to learn them as separate verbs, so the rules are explained here.

<br>

#### Potential verb formation

/// Group 1: [る → られる]

/// Group 2: Change the final {u} to {e} and add る

/// Group 3: [くる → こられる]

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: たべる → たべられる

/// G2: かく → かける

<br>

/// There is no potential form for する; the corresponding verb that expresses ability and possibility is できる.

<br>

#### Verb grouping of potential verbs

/// All derived potential verbs conjugate as Group 1 verbs.

/// For instance, the conjunctive form is conjugated from potential verbs as follows: たべられる→たべられて, はなせる→はなせて, こられる→こられ て.

<br>

#### が or を as the direct object marker with potential verbs

/// The use of が as the object marker of a potential verb has already been pointed out.

<br>

パクさんは日本語が話せます。//Park-san can speak Japanese.

<br>

/// All potential verbs derived from transitive verbs become semi-transitive, because they have a non-action meaning.

/// Therefore, が is used to mark the direct object. In actual use, however, を may sometimes be used to mark the direct object rather than が.

/// This happens when the potential form is derived from a verb with a strong inherent transitive meaning, and thus を is almost considered an inseparable part of the verb.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Passive verbs

/// In English, a passive verb is constructed by combining an auxiliary verb such as “is” or “are” with a past participle such as “eaten” and “taken.” The thing or person who does the action is preceded by the preposition “by.”

/// In Japanese, passive meanings are expressed with derived passive verbs, just as potential meanings are expressed with derived potential verbs.

<br>

#### Passive verb formation

/// Group 1, 2: Change the final vowel u to the vowel a and add れる

/// Group 3: [する → される], [くる → こられる]

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: たべる → たべられる, みる → みられる

/// G2: かく → かかれる, かう → かわれる

<br>

/// Like derived potential forms, all derived passive forms are Group 1 verbs.

/// The following examples show how the conjunctive form is conjugated: たべられる → たべられて, かかれる → かかれて, こられる → こられて

<br>

/// In passive sentences, the agent (the person or thing doing the action) is marked by the particle に.

<br>

この大学では、日本語は多くの学生に勉強されている。//Japanese is studied by many students at this college.

この本は有名な人に書かれました。//This book was written by a famous person.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Causative verbs

/// Causation refers to a situation in which a person is caused to do something by another person or thing.

/// This may occur in a variety of circumstances where a person “forces/allows/lets/has someone do something.”

<br>

/// In English, causative sentences are constructed with such verbs as “make,” “let,” or “allow,” as in “I make my child drink milk every day.”

/// In this particular sentence, the sense of “making (someone) do (something)” is the causative element.

<br>

/// In Japanese, causative verbs may be used to express causation in certain circumstances.

/// There are also other constructions that also express “causation.”

<br>

#### Causative verb formation

/// Group 1: Change る to させる

/// Group 2: Change the final {u} to {a} and add せる

/// Group 3: [する → させる], [くる → こさせる]

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: たべる → たべさせる, おしえる → おしえさせる

/// G2: かく → かかせる, かう → かわせる

<br>

/// All derived causative verbs are Group 1 verbs.

/// The following examples show how they conjugate: たべさせる → たべさせて, かわせる → かわせて.

<br>

/// Causative sentences typically involve two people. The person who causes something is in the topic position.

/// The person who is caused to do something is marked by に

<br>

/// Causative verbs are often used when a person of greater authority makes another person with less authority do something.

<br>

#### Causative passive verbs

/// [Change the causative ending ~せる to ~せられる]

<br>

/// Because they are transitive, it is possible to make causative sentences into passive sentences — that is, causative-passive sentences.

/// For instance, the two causative sentences above may be expressed by causative-passive sentences.

/// Causative-passive sentences are used when the object in a causative sentence is in the topic position.

/// Because all causative verbs are Group 1 verbs, changing them into passive verbs is quite simple.

<br>

日本語の先生は毎週、学生に作文を書かせます。//The Japanese teacher makes her students write a composition every week.

両親は晩ご飯の後、私に宿題をさせます。//My parents make me do my homework after dinner.

<br>

日本語の学生は先生に毎週、作文を書かせられます。//The Japanese students are made to write a composition every week by their teacher.

私は両親に晩ご飯の後、宿題をさせられます。//I am forced by my parents to do my homework after dinner.

# Stage 2-1 Conjunctive Forms and Their Uses

## 1: The Continuous Aspect

### (1) Conjunctive forms

/// the rules for the conjunctive forms are exactly the same as those for the plain positive perfective forms except for the final syllable.

/// Instead of ending the form with た or だ, as in the plain positive perfectives, the conjunctive forms end in て or で.

<br>

### (2) The continuous aspect of repeatable (punctual) verbs

/// The て-form and the verb いる together express the continuous aspect of an action, event, or state.

/// whether the continuous meaning is one of action or state depends on the type of verb.

<br>

/// Verbs such as “to eat” and “to study” denote actions that one can repeat or do continuously.

/// For these verbs, the construction with ~て and いる indicates repeated actions.

/// This construction therefore has two different meanings, as indicated below:

<br>

日本語を勉強しています。//I am currently studying Japanese.

/// or “I have been studying Japanese for some time.”

<br>

#### The continuous aspect of non-action verbs

/// Some stative verbs, such as some semi-transitive verbs, do not use the ~ている construction.

/// These verbs are stative in meaning, and thus are already continuous in nature.

<br>

私はいい辞書がいります。//I need a good dictionary.

私は日本語が話せます。//I am able to speak Japanese.

<br>

/// ~ている may not be used to express ideas above, as shown in the following incorrect sentences:

<br>

#### When a verb has more than one meaning

/// A single word often has multiple meanings. One such example is the verb 分かる {わかる}.

/// The following sentence indicates that the topic has a specific ability; the verb therefore has a stative meaning.

<br>

私は日本語が分かります。//I understand Japanese.

/// [ = I have the ability to understand Japanese.]

<br>

/// The idea in the sentence above cannot be expressed with ~ている, because having the ability to do something refers to a state or condition, rather than an action or an event.

<br>

/// The verb 分かる has a second meaning, however: “to figure something out.”

/// This verb may also be used to talk about having obtained knowledge about a specific thing or person.

/// This meaning indicates a process, rather than a state. When the verb carries this meaning, the ~ている construction can be used.

<br>

あの人のことはよく分かっています。//I have heard a lot about that person, and I now have a good understanding of him.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) The continuous aspect of non-repeatable (punctual) verbs

/// Verbs such as the second meaning of 分かる {わかる} “to figure something out” and 起きる {おきる} “to get up” denote a one-time, non-repeatable action.

/// This type of verb is sometimes termed a “punctual verb.”

/// The て-form of these verbs, when used with いる, indicates that the action has been completed, and the topic is currently in the state of maintaining the completed action.

<br>

起きています。//I am up.

<br>

/// The sentence above does not refer to the process of getting up, but rather the state of being awake after the action of getting up has been completed.

/// With a punctual verb such as 起きる, Japanese speakers normally use either the positive imperfective to say “I will get up soon,” or use ~ている to say “I am up already.”

/// They will seldom utter a sentence that is equivalent to “I am in the process of getting up.”

<br>

#### The verb 知る {しる}

/// The verb 知る, often translated as “to know,” and the verb 分かる, translated as “to understand,” are similar in meaning.

/// 知る implies obtaining information, while 分かる implies having an ability to figure things out, and also refers to the process of figuring things out.

<br>

/// The ~ている construction with the verb 知る is used to talk about the possession of knowledge.

<br>

私はあの人の名前を知っています。//I know that person’s name.

<br>

/// the ~ている construction cannot be used as the negative of 知っている {しっている}

/// To say that a person does not possess knowledge of something, the imperfective negative is used, rather than the negative of the ~ている construction:

<br>

私はあの人の名前を知りません。//I don’t know that person’s name.

<br>

/// When asking whether a person possesses a certain piece of information, the negative 知りませんか {しりませんか} is used as often as the positive 知っていますか {しっていますか}.

<br>

あの人の電話番号を知りませんか。//Do you know that person’s phone number?

あの人の電話番号を知っていますか。//Do you know that person’s phone number?

<br>

#### 持つ {もつ} vs. ある

/// Both 持つ and ある are normally translated into English as the verb “to have.”

/// One significant difference between the two is that 持つ implies that the topic is physically holding something; ある does not include this implication.

/// For instance, if someone is carrying a bag, the verb 持つ must be used, rather than ある:

<br>

あの人は何を持っていますか。//What does that person have?

鞄を持っています。//He has a bag.

<br>

/// To talk about possession of an abstract item at a specific time, ある is normally used.

<br>

今日、僕は時間がたくさんあります。//I have a lot of time today.

<br>

/// When talking about possessing abstract things such as 考え {かんがえ} “thoughts” or “ideas” at a non-specific time, 持つ may also be used:

<br>

あの人はいい考えをたくさん持っています。//He has a lot of good ideas.

<br>

/// Both ある and 持つ may be used to talk about possession of things, concepts, or ideas rather than physically carrying something:

<br>

時雨さんはお金をたくさん持っています。//Shigure-san has possesses a lot of money.

時雨さんはお金がたくさんあります。//Shigure-san has a lot of money.

時雨さんの家はお金がたくさんあります。//The Shigure estate has a lot of money.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) The continuous aspect of directional verbs

/// The following sentence contains a directional verb in the ~ている aspect.

<br>

パクさんは日本に行っています。//Park-san has gone to Japan.

<br>

/// It means that the act of going to Japan has been completed

<br>

加藤さんはここに来ています。//Kato-san has arrived.

父は家に帰っています。//My father has come home.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Joining Predicates

### (1) Joining two predicates

/// the conjunctive form is used to join clauses.

<br>

#### Non-action (stative) predicates

<br>

私はクリスで、日本語の学生です。//I’m Kurisu, a student of Japanese.

中国は大きくて、遠いです。//China is both large and far away.

あの人は英語も話せて、漢字も読めます。//That person can speak English, and can read kanji too.

<br>

#### Action verbs

/// the order of actions is implied.

/// the first action mentioned is understood as being completed before the action mentioned next begins.

/// the aspect of the final verb determines the aspect of all the actions in the sentence.

/// This is because the conjunctive form lacks aspectual forms.

<br>

私は勉強して、運動します。//I will study and then exercise.

私は勉強して、運動しました。//I studied and then exercised.

<br>

/// When two clauses have different topics, however, the order of actions is not implicit, as it would be with a single topic:

<br>

昨日、僕は勉強して、時雨さんは運動しました。//I studied, but Shigure-san exercised yesterday.

<br>

#### Color terms and how to join them

/// most primary colors have both adjectival and nominal forms.

/// For example, 赤 {あか}, a noun, and 赤い {あかい}, an adjective, are both words for “red.”

/// Similarly, the adjectives 黒い {くろい} “black,” 青い {あおい} “blue,” and 白い {しろい} “white” have the nominal forms 黒 {くろ}, 青 {あお}, and 白 {しろ} respectively.

<br>

/// When a nominal color term modifies a noun, the particle の must be used between the two nouns, with the color term being the first element.

/// の is required because the color terms are nouns rather than adjectives.

/// 赤のかばん  黒のペン

<br>

/// Some color terms, such as 緑 {みどり} and 緑色 {みどりいろ}, which both mean “green,” do not have the adjectival options. These words are nouns.

<br>

/// Japanese color terms sometimes differ from those in English regarding the range of color that each term refers to on the color spectrum.

/// For instance, the green of a traffic light in Japan is referred to as 青 {あお} “blue,” even though it is a greenish color. This is because the term 青 {あお} covers a wider range of colors than the English term “blue.”

<br>

/// When two descriptive predicates are applied to a single topic, it is understood that each of the predicates describes the topic completely.

<br>

この本は小さくて、高いです。//This is a small, expensive book.

<br>

/// When using more than one color term to describe an item, the nominal forms of the color terms with the conjunction と must be used.

<br>

私の鞄は赤と黒です。//My bag is black and red.

<br>

/// When two different color terms are used to describe two different topics in a single sentence, however, the conjunctive construction may be used.

/// Each color describes only one topic.

<br>

あの鞄は赤くて、この鞄は黒いです。//That bag is red, and this bag is black.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) When the first nominal or adjectival predicate is negative

/// Since all negative plain forms end with ~い (from ~ない), all negatives are conjugated according to the rules for adjectives.

/// The following examples use the conjunctive forms of negative nominal and adjectival predicates to join other predicates:

<br>

私は日本人じゃなくて、中国人です。//I’m not Japanese, I’m Chinese.

この寿司は美味しくなくて、高いです。//This sushi doesn’t taste good, but it’s expensive.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) When the first verbal predicate is negative

/// -> ["~ないで, ..."]

/// When the initial predicate is a negative verbal predicate, it is joined differently to the predicate that follows.

/// The meaning of the sentence is also different.

/// In this case, the combination of the plain negative imperfective of a verb and the conjunctive of the copula で is used to join the negative verbal predicate to a second predicate.

<br>

/// The meaning of the sentence is that the action described in the second predicate is, or will be, begun without completing the action described in the first predicate.

<br>

朝ご飯を食べないで、学校に行きました。//I went to school without eating breakfast first.

勉強しないで、試験を受けました。//I took an exam without studying first.

<br>

/// When the conjunctive form of a negative imperfective verb is used, the clause takes on a causal meaning.

/// The independent clause indicates naturally occurring consequences such as 困る {こまる} “feel troubled; feel worried,” as seen below:

<br>

この宿題が分からないて、困っています。//I’m worried because I don’t understand this assignment.

<br>

/// two or more different types of predicates (e.g. nominal and adjectival predicates) may be joined by the conjunctive form to make a single sentence.

/// However, in this case, action and non-action predicates may not be joined by the conjunctive form to make a single sentence, unless the sentence expresses a cause-consequence relation.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Joining predicates with ~てから

#### The sentential conjunction それから

/// adds the meaning of “from that point on,” or “after completing that action.”

<br>

私は朝ご飯を食べました。それから、走りました。//I ate breakfast. After that, I went running.

<br>

/// The two separate sentences above can be joined by putting the first predicate into the て-form followed by から (from それから).

/// This does not change the meaning.

<br>

私は朝ご飯を食べてから、走りました。//After eating breakfast, I went running.

<br>

/// ~てから may not be used for a non-action predicate, because ~てから expresses the completion of an action.

/// Non-action predicates have nothing to “complete.” Such an idea is impossible in English as well as in Japanese:

<br>

#### The difference between the use of ~て only and ~てから

<br>

私は図書館に行って、本を読みました。//I went to the library, where I read a book.

私は図書館に行ってから、本を読みました。//After visiting the library, I read a book.

<br>

/// The only structural difference between the two sentences above is the use of から after the conjunctive form 行って {いって}.

/// The first sentence means that the topic went to the library; there in the library the next action—reading a book—took place.

<br>

/// The second sentence, however, indicates that the visit to the library was completed at the time of speaking.

/// The next action, reading a book, is expressed as a separate action.

/// The sentence does not indicate that reading the book took place in the library (it could be either at the library or somewhere else).

<br>

/// When the two clauses have different topics, the topic of the clause with ~てから must be marked by が; the topic of the main clause must be marked by は.

<br>

加藤さんが勉強してから、私達は映画に行きました。//After Kato-san finished studying, we went to the movie.

<br>

/// If the speaker wants to say that going to the movie took place only after Kato-san had finished studying, this cannot be expressed by simply joining the predicate with the て-form alone.

/// In this case, から must follow the て-form between the two clauses.

<br>

/// Compare also the Japanese sentence above with its English translation, in which the order of the dependent and independent clauses is not fixed.

/// In Japanese, the dependent clause (which is the adverbial clause in the above case) must be expressed first, followed by the independent (main) clause.

/// The clauses are never reversed except in casual conversation (with a specific meaning).

<br>

/// Learners of Japanese often confuse sentences using the causal conjunction から with those using ~ てから, which indicates the completion of an action.

/// The two have rather different meanings, however.

<br>

コーヒーを飲んだから、家を出ました。//Because I had drunk my coffee, I left the house.

コーヒーを飲んでから、家を出ました。//After I had drunk my coffee, I left the house.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Polite Commands and Requests

/// -> ["the conjunctive form of a verb" + 下さい]

### (1) Positive commands and requests

/// Teachers of Japanese often use the conjunctive form of a verb and ください (the kanji 下さい may be used for ください) to instruct their students to do certain activities in class.

/// This construction is used to indicate a polite command.

/// The same structure may also be used for a polite request, depending on the situation.

/// The difference between a command and a request is not cut-and-dried; it is based more on social context rather than any clear linguistic differentiation.

<br>

/// The following sentence might be a command if it were used by an instructor; used by a store clerk, it could be a request.

<br>

ここに名前を書いて下さい。//Write your name here.

<br>

/// Regardless of any ambiguity, when ませんか is added to this construction, the request or command becomes more polite.

<br>

日本語を話して下さい。//Please speak Japanese.

日本語を話して下さいませんか。//May I ask you to speak Japanese?

<br>

/// The polite command is normally used in a formal setting, as when a teacher is addressing his or her students, or a customer is speaking to a taxi driver.

/// This construction is too polite to be used by a parent to address his or her children.

<br>

/// Polite requests may be used by a student to a teacher, by a store clerk to a customer, or when speaking to a stranger, for example.

/// There are many levels of politeness in Japanese

<br>

### (2) Negative commands and requests

/// -> ["the plain negative imperfective form" + で + ください  (+ ませんか)]

/// The structure of the polite negative command or request is constructed with the plain negative imperfective form and the conjunctive form of the copula で, with ください added for a command and a request.

/// くださいませんか is added for politeness with commands and requests.

/// The conjunctive form of the negative imperfective form, ~なくて, should not be used to make a negative command or request.

<br>

日本語を話さないで下さい。//Please do not speak Japanese.

日本語を話さないで下さいませんか。//Would you please not speak Japanese?

<br>

#### Deadline particle までに

/// The particle までに expresses the time required to complete an action.

/// Do not confuse it with the particle まで, which indicates an ending point.

<br>

明日、ここに五時までに来て下さい。//Please come here by 5:00 tomorrow.

今日、ここに五時までいます。//I will stay here until 5:00 today.

<br>

### (3) ください（ませんか） with no preceding verbs

/// ください（ませんか） can be used on its own without a verb to request something.

<br>

ペンを下さい。//Please give me a pen.

ペンを下さいませんか。//Would you please give me a pen?

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Other Functions of the て-form

### (1) Means

/// the て-form of the verb in the first predicate can join the verb in the second predicate 

/// to indicate that the actions in the two clauses take place in the same order as the verbs are mentioned.

<br>

朝、起きて、走りました。//In the morning I got up, and then I went running.

<br>

/// the conjunctive form of a certain verb may be used to express means

<br>

私は歩いて、学校に行きます。//I go to school on foot.

<br>

/// The above sentence, however, cannot be construed to say “I walked first, and then I went to school.”

/// Rather, the two actions—walking and going to school—take place simultaneously; the first verb expresses the means of going.

<br>

### (2) Permission ~てもいい

/// The conjunctive form followed by the particle も and the adjective いい expresses “permission” to do something.

<br>

これを食べてもいいですか。//May I eat this?

ええ、いいですよ。どうぞ、食べてください。//Yes, you may. Please, go ahead and eat it.

<br>

/// どうぞ is used to strongly encourage the addressee to do something.

<br>

/// When the speaker wants to deny the request, the following construction may be used:

<br>

いいえ。ぞれは食べないでください。//No. Please don’t eat that.

<br>

### (3) Prohibition ~てはいけない

/// The conjunctive form of a verb with the particle は and いけない together indicates that something is prohibited.

<br>

これを食べてもいいですか。//May I eat this?

いいえ。それは食べてはいけません。//No. You mustn’t eat that.

<br>

### (4) ~てみる

/// The verb 見る has a few different meanings such as “to see,” “to look,” or “to watch.”

/// When this verb is combined with other verbs in the conjunctive form, its meaning becomes somewhat more abstract, expressing something like “examine the result of [the action expressed by the preceding verb].”

/// みる is not normally written in kanji in such a construction.

<br>

寿司を食べてみました。//I tried eating sushi.

<br>

/// The final verb みる is changed to express aspect:

<br>

寿司を食べてみます。//I will try eating sushi.

寿司を食べてみてください。//Try eating some sushi.

<br>

/// The construction ~てみる is frequently translated with the verb “try” in English.

/// The English word “try,” however, has different meanings, not all of which can be conveyed by ~てみる.

/// For instance, the verb “try” has a connotation of “making an effort.” So, if the speaker is asked to come home early tonight, he or she might say, “I will try to come home early.” In this case, the verb “try” does not convey the same meaning as it does in “I tried eating sushi.”

/// ~てみる only focuses on examining the result of doing or having done the action expressed by the conjunctive form of the first verb.

<br>

### (5) ~てしまう

/// The verb しまう means “to put things away.”

/// It is used as a regular verb, as in the following:

<br>

母からの手紙を机の中にしまいました。//I put the letters from my mother away inside the desk.

<br>

#### Intentional acts

/// When combined with the て-form of a verb, especially when the verb indicates something that the topic has control over,

/// the use of しまう in the predicate signifies the completion of an event.

<br>

そのケーキを食べてしまって下さい。//Please finish eating that cake.

ルームメートはもう宿題をしてしまいました。//My roommate has already finished doing her homework.

<br>

#### Unintentional events or unexpected results

/// then the event expressed by the predicate with しまう is an unintended, or unexpected, result.

<br>

バスの中で寝てしまいました。//I accidentally fell asleep on the bus.

今学期、日本語を勉強しなかったら、全部、漢字を忘れてしまいました。//I didn’t study Japanese this semester, and I completely forgot all the kanji.

<br>

/// If the speaker has eaten, the predicate is simply repeated:

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Using the polite form in speech

<br>

何、読んでますか。//What are you reading?

日本語の小説です。//A Japanese novel.

<br>

/// ~ている is often shortened in casual speech by deleting the い, so that it becomes ~てる.

/// The polite form can also follow this pattern: one may say ~てます rather than ~ています when speaking.

/// Deleting this い gives a more casual sense in both cases.

<br>

今、食べている。//I’m eating now.

今、食べてる。//I’m eating now.

今、たべています。//I’m eating now.

今、食べてます。//I’m eating now.

試験ですか。大変ですね。頑張ってくださいね。//Really? Sounds tough. Good luck.

<br>

#### 大変ですね

/// 大変 {たいへん}, an adjectival noun, can mean many things. It may mean “difficult; hard; laborious; dreadful; awful; immense” and so on.

/// When used to describe a person, it may convey something like “difficult to deal with; unreasonable; unreal; awful” and similar ideas.

/// 大変ですね is often used as a backchannel to express some kind of sympathy or empathy.

<br>

#### 頑張ってください {がんばってください}

/// Japanese speakers use this phrase a great deal in conversation.

/// It is used to convey good wishes, or wishes for a good result, with reference to a current or upcoming situation or endeavor which may be difficult for the addressee.

/// In casual conversation, ください is deleted; 頑張って {かんばって} alone is used.

<br>

### (3) 先輩 {せんぱい} and 後輩 {こうはい}

<br>

ああ、お腹、すいた！//Wow, I’m hungry!

先輩、まだ、食べてないんですか。//Haven’t you eaten yet, Senpai?

うん、まだ。これ、食べていい？//Not yet. Can I have this?

大丈夫ですよ。心配しないでください。さあ、食べてください。//It’s all right. Don’t worry. Please go ahead and eat it.

<br>

#### 先輩 {せんぱい}・後輩 {こうはい}

/// 先輩 refers to an individual who is senior to the speaker within a group, such as an extracurricular group, a club, or any other organized group. It may also simply refer to the speaker’s mentor.

/// 後輩 is the junior in relation to 先輩.

/// Instead of using the person’s name, the junior speaker may address the senior person as 先輩.

/// Note, however, that the term 後輩 may not be used to address another person.

<br>

#### 食べていい？

/// も may be deleted in casual speech, as in the above sentence.

/// 食べていい？ is therefore a casual way to say 食べてもいいですか.

<br>

#### どうぞ、どうぞ

/// As explained earlier in this chapter, どうぞ is used to emphatically invite an addressee to do something (to eat, in the example above).

/// Repeating the word makes it stronger.

<br>

#### の in question sentences

/// When the sentence-final particle の is used in question sentences in casual conversation, it functions the same as んですか;

/// that is, the speaker is confirming his or her understanding with the addressee.

<br>

#### 心配 {しんぱい}しないでください

/// 心配 is a noun that means “anxiety” or “worry.”

/// 心配しないでください is used to comfort the addressee.

/// The phrase means something like “There is no need for you to worry”; or “Don’t worry.”

# Stage 2-2 Adjectival Clauses

## 1: Predicates in the Non-Final Position

### (1) Plain forms in the final and non-final positions

/// plain forms have a number of different functions.

/// When they are used in the final position of a sentence in speech, it indicates that the relationship between speaker and addressee is close (close friends, family members, classmates, etc.);

/// when used in writing, it indicates that it is impersonal writing (the writer is not addressing any particular individual).

<br>

/// When a predicate is used in a non-final position in a sentence, the plain predicate is used regardless of the speech (or written) style.

<br>

### (2) Compound vs. complex sentences

/// As complex sentences and compound sentences are often confused. Understanding the difference between complex sentences and compound sentences is important when forming and using plain and polite predicates.

<br>

#### Compound sentences

/// A compound sentence consists of two or more independent clauses that are joined by a conjunction.

/// an independent clause is one that can be used alone as a sentence without being preceded or followed by another clause.

/// the conjunction が may be used between two independent clauses.

<br>

/// The order of clauses in a compound sentence can be reversed without affecting meaning.

/// The order may be important for other reasons, such as politeness, or order of importance, but the logical meaning is not changed by reversing their order; this is because neither clause modifies the other.

<br>

チャンさんは中国人ですが、私は日本人です。//Chang-san is Chinese, and I’m Japanese.

私は日本人ですが、チャンさんは中国人です。//I’m Japanese, and Chang-san is Chinese.

<br>

/// The two clauses joined by が must have the same predicate form; that is, they must either be all polite or all plain. They cannot be mixed.

<br>

私は日本人だが、チャンさんは中国人だ。//I’m Japanese, and Chang-san is Chinese.

<br>

#### Complex sentences

/// A complex sentence consists of at least one dependent clause and one independent clause.

/// the function of a dependent clause is the same as that of an adjective or adverb, but on the level of a clause rather than a word.

/// These dependent clauses are therefore called adverbial and adjectival clauses.

/// Because they function adjectivally and adverbially, they must be used before the independent clauses;

/// Unlike Compound sentences, the order cannot be reversed.

<br>

### (3) The concept of adjectival clauses

/// These clauses are handled differently in English and Japanese.

/// The first difference is that in English, the adverbial clause is placed after the noun it modifies; in Japanese it is placed before the noun.

/// The second difference is that the pronouns “that” and “who” used in the adjectival clauses in the English sentences do not exist in Japanese.

<br>

私は昨日、買った本を読みました。//I read the book that I bought yesterday.

先生と話している男の人は私のルームメートです。//The man who is speaking with the teacher is my roommate.

<br>

/// To summarize, the following points are relevant to sentences with adjectival clauses:

/// - The adjectival clause must be placed before the noun it modifies;

/// - The predicate within the adjectival clause is in the plain form;

/// - If the two topics is the different, The topic in the adjectival clause must be marked by が, the topic in the independent clause must be marked by は.

/// If the two topics are the same, the topic in the adjectival clause is normally deleted; there is no need to mark each one with が and は.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Modified Nouns

### (1) Modifying regular nouns

#### A noun modifying a noun

/// -> [N1 の N0] => N0 of N1

/// the particle の must be used between the two nouns.

/// In this case, the preceding noun modifies the following one:

/// 先生の本     東京の大学

<br>

#### An adjectival noun modifying a noun

/// -> [adj-N な N]

/// When an adjectival noun modifies a noun, the particle な must be placed immediately before the noun it modifies.

<br>

あの人は嫌な人です。//That person is a nasty person.

<br>

#### An adjective modifying a noun

/// -> [adj N]

/// When an adjective modifies a noun, it is placed immediately before the noun it modifies and no particle is used between them.

<br>

これはいい本です。//This is a good book.

<br>

#### A clause modifying a noun (adjectival clause)

<br>

私は昨日、買った本を読みました。//I read the book that I bought yesterday.

私は昨日、クリスさんが買った本を読みました。//I read the book that Kurisu-san bought yesterday.

<br>

/// any of the three predicate types (nominal, adjectival, or verbal) can be used in the adjectival clause.

/// When a nominal predicate in an adjectival clause contains a noun, の must be used between the two nouns.

/// When a nominal predicate in an adjectival clause contains an adjectival noun, な must be used between the adjectival noun and the noun.

/// When an adjectival predicate and a verbal predicate are used in an adjectival clause, no element is necessary between the adjective or the verb and the noun it modifies.

<br>

私は出身が日本の学生と友達になりました。//I made friends with a student from Japan.

私は目がとてもきれいな人と話しました。//I talked to a person with pretty eyes.

私は先生がとてもいい大学に行っています。//I go to a college that has good teachers.

<br>

私は昨日クリスさんの買った本を読みました。//I read the book that Kurisu-san bought yesterday.

<br>

#### The use of の in adjectival clauses

/// One additional fact about adjectival clauses is that the topic, subject, and object marker が in the adjectival clause may be replaced by の in most predicates.

<br>

/// The following sentence indicates the use of の for the topic position in the adjectival clause:

<br>

私は昨日ジョンさんの買った本を読みました。//I read the book that John bought yesterday.

<br>

/// The following sentences indicate the use of の for the subject position in the adjectival clause:

<br>

私は目のとてもきれいな人と話しました。//I talked to a person with pretty eyes.

私は先生のとてもいい大学に行っています。//I go to a college with good teachers.

<br>

/// The following sentence indicates the use of の in the object position in the adjectival clause:

<br>

私は日本語の上手な学生と話しました。//I talked with a student who is good at Japanese.

<br>

/// In some isolated cases, の may replace the object marker を, especially when the object is topicalized, as shown below:

<br>

昨日、名前の知らない学生と話しました。//Yesterday I spoke to a student whose name is unknown to me.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) こと as a regular and functional noun

/// こと can be used as a regular noun or a functional noun.

/// As a regular noun, it refers to abstract things,

/// while もの is used to refer to concrete things or concepts (“ideas,” “music,” “habits,” and so on are examples of concepts).

/// When もの refers to concepts, it is not normally written in kanji (物).

<br>

面白いことを聞きました。//I heard an interesting thing.

面白い物を買いました。//I bought an interesting thing.

面白いものを習っています。//I am learning an interesting thing.

<br>

/// こと is here called a functional noun because it is not used as a noun with a referent, but rather gives the preceding verb a nominal function.

<br>

私は本を読むことが好きです。//I like to read books.

<br>

### (3) の as a pronoun

/// の, on the other hand, is a pronoun, as shown below. の is used in the second sentence to refer to the noun 本.

<br>

彼は面白い本を買いました。でも、僕はつまらないの買いました。//He bought an interesting book, but I bought a boring one.

<br>

/// の is also used to nominalize the preceding verb, just as こと is.

<br>

私は本を読むのが好きです。//I like to read books.

<br>

### (4) こと and の as nominalizers

/// こと and の as nominalizers are interchangeable in many cases.

<br>

/// The following pair of sentences illustrates that both こと and の may be used to nominalize verbs in the topic position.

<br>

日本語を話すことは難しいです。//Speaking Japanese is difficult.

日本語を話すのは難しいです。//Speaking Japanese is difficult.

<br>

/// The following sentence pair shows cases in which こと and の are used to nominalize verbs in the object position.

<br>

私は寿司を食べることが好きです。//I like to eat sushi.

私は寿司を食べるのが好きです。//I like to eat sushi.

<br>

/// Although こと and の can often be used identically, there are cases in which they are not interchangeable, such as in fixed expressions, and other differences

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Fixed Expressions

/// In all of the following fixed expressions, the functional nouns such as こと and ほう are modified by adjectival clauses.

<br>

### (1) ことができる

/// When a nominalized verb is in the object position with the verb できる, only こと rather than の may be used as a nominalizer.

/// The fixed expression with ことができる indicates the ability or possibility of the topic in the same way as the potential verb does.

<br>

僕は日本語ができます。//I have some Japanese ability.

<br>

/// The potential form is used more often in conversation than the expression with ことができる.

/// The fixed expression is more formal.

<br>

僕は日本語を話すことができます。//I can speak Japanese.

この店で日本語を話すことが出来ます。//It’s possible to speak Japanese at this store.

<br>

僕は日本語が話せます。//I can speak Japanese.

この店で日本語が話せます。//It is possible to speak Japanese at this store.

<br>

### (2) [Perfective verb] ことがある

/// This fixed expression is used to talk about past experiences. In this structure, the perfective form must be used before ことがある.

<br>

私は日本に行ったことがあります。//I have been to Japan.

<br>

/// The noun こと in this construction means something like “occasion” or “experience.”

/// The sentence above therefore literally means that “I have the experience of having gone to Japan.”

/// In this construction, の may not be used in place of こと

<br>

/// Negative or positive responses are reflected in the last verb, ある, rather than in the non-final verb.

<br>

寿司を食べたことがありますか。//Have you ever eaten sushi?

ええ、あります。//Yes, I have.

<br>

/// In a negative response, it is common to add 一度も {いちども} “not even once” to the negative ありませ ん

<br>

いいえ、一度もありません。//No. Not even once.

<br>

/// The imperfective form should not be used before ことがある to talk about a past experience; this construction has quite a different meaning from the one with the perfective form.

<br>

### (3) [Perfective verb] ほうがいい

/// The functional noun 方 {ほう}, which literally means “side” or “way,” is used to suggest or indicate a better or preferred way to do something.

/// For this construction, the verb must be in the perfective form.

/// The perfective form is preferred in this fixed phrase because one can judge something to be good only after the action is completed.

/// This assumed completion is expressed with the perfective form.

<br>

明日、行った方がいいですよ。//You’d better go tomorrow.

<br>

/// For a negative suggestion, the negative imperfective should be used.

<br>

明日、行かない方がいいですよ。//It would be better if you didn’t go tomorrow.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: [Specific Name] と いう [Generic Name]

### (1) In a statement

/// This construction is used when the speaker assumes that the addressee does not know the specific name of the thing being discussed.

/// This expression is rather formulaic, insofar as the first noun should be a specific name, and the second noun should be a category that the specific thing named by the first noun belongs to.

/// という comes from the quotative particle と and the verb 言う {いう}, but in this expression, いう is not written in kanji.

<br>

/// 東京という所 “a place called Tokyo”

/// マイクという学生 “a student called Mike”

/// すしという食べ物 “a food called sushi”

/// 音楽というもの “a thing called music”

<br>



私はナンシーという学生に会いました。//I met a student called Nancy.

高校の先生は鈴木という先生でした。//I had a high school teacher called Suzuki

<br>

### (2) Definition

/// There are many different ways to ask for definitions.

<br>

旅行という言葉は英語で何ですか。//What is the word for 'Ryokou' in English?

<br>

/// The pronoun の may be used in place of 言葉 {ことば} in the above sentence because the referent is clear from the context.

<br>

旅行というのは英語で何ですか。//What’s the word for 'Ryokou' in English?

<br>

/// There are many sentence structures that can be used to give definitions. The following is one such structure:

<br>

旅行というのはトラベルという意味です。//'Ryokou' means ‘travel.’

<br>

/// どういう is often used to ask for defining or rephrasing a word, a phrase, etc.

<br>

読書というのはどういう意味ですか。//What does 'Dokusho' mean?

<br>

/// ということ is often used when defining something by rephrasing.

<br>

読書というのは本を読むということです。//'Dokusho' means to read a book.

<br>

### (3) ということ

/// is used to rephrase the content of a message.

<br>

私はあの人はー年生だということを聞きました。//I heard someone saying that he was a freshman.

私は昨日のテストは易しかったということを聞きました。//I heard someone saying that yesterday’s test was easy.

<br>

/// Compare the above with the following:

<br>

私はあの人は一年生だと聞きました。//I heard someone saying that guy was a freshman.

私は昨日のテストは易しかったと聞きました。//I heard someone saying that yesterday’s test was easy.

<br>

/// The difference between the sentences with and without ということ is as follows:

/// - Sentences without ということ express the content of what the speaker has heard directly.

/// - Sentences with ということ indicate that the speaker has rephrased his or her own understanding from what he or she has heard someone say about the content.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) What did she say?

<br>

お母さん、何て？//What did Mom say?

うん。あまり好きじゃないって。//Um, she said she didn’t like it all that much.

<br>

#### 何て {なんて}？

/// 何て is a colloquial version of 何と言いましたか “What did (someone) say?” This expression is used very often in conversation.

<br>

/// ~って in spoken language is a shortened version of と言いました, meaning “(someone) said such-and-such.”

/// Therefore, the content of the message goes before ~って.

<br>

### (2) What do you mean?

<br>

それ、どういうこと？　行かないっていうこと？//What do you mean by that? Does that mean you won’t go?

まあ、そういうこと。//Yeah, pretty much.

<br>



#### どういうこと

/// This expression is used to ask for some clarification of what the speaker has just heard the addressee say; it means something like “What do you mean by that?”

<br>

/// ~っていうこと used in the predicate is a colloquial version of ということ, meaning “I mean (content).”

<br>

#### そういうこと

/// This expression is used to concur with what the other person has said, thought, or assumed.

/// When used in a question, it is used to confirm the other person’s (or sometimes one’s own) understanding of what was said.

/// こういうこと may also be used to summarize what the speaker has said.

<br>

### (3) What does it mean?

<br>

登山って、どういう意味？//What does 'tosan' mean?

山に登るってことよ。//It means to climb mountains.

<br>

#### ~って in the first clause

/// 登山って {とざんって} is a shortened spoken version of 登山というのは.

/// 登る {のぼる} means “to climb.”

<br>

<br>

彼、何て行ってた？//What did he say?

行かないって。//He said he’s not going.

そう。残念だけど、しかたないね。//Really. That’s too bad, but what can we do?

<br>

#### 残念 {ざんねん}

/// This adjectival noun means that the speaker feels sorry about what he or she has just heard or learned about.

<br>

#### しかたない

/// This is a shortened phrase; the complete expression is しかたがない.

/// しかた means “way of dealing with something.”

/// So, the literal meaning of this expression is “There’s no way to deal with this.”

/// This phrase, which is used when the speaker wishes to indicate that he or she will have to accept a situation as it is.

/// Another expression, しようがない, has the same meaning as しかたがない;

/// しようがない is often contracted to しょうがない when speaking colloquially.stage ２，３。

# Stage 2-3 Adjectival Clauses

## 1: Adverbial Clauses

### (1) The concept of adverbial clauses

/// Two types of adverbial clauses were introduced. 

/// The first type uses the conjunction から to give a reason for something.

/// The second type indicates a time condition by using conjunctions 時 {とき}, 前 {まえ}, and 後 {あと}.

<br>

### (2) Adverbial clauses with the causal conjunction から

/// the cause or reason for a certain consequence may be expressed in a dependent clause joined by the conjunction から.

<br>

どうして、昨日、授業を休みましたか。//Why were you absent from class yesterday?

昨日、私は、母が病気だったから、授業を休みました。//I didn’t go to class yesterday because my mother was sick.

<br>

/// There are a few important points to remember for these constructions:

/// - Of the three interrogative pronouns, なぜ is the most formal, followed by どうして, and then なん で, the most colloquial.

/// - The predicate form before から is normally in the plain form, although the polite form may be used in very polite speech.

/// - The main clause in the response may be abbreviated by だ（or です） in conversation.

/// - When the topics in the dependent and independent clauses are not the same, use が for the topic in the dependent clause and は for the independent clause.

<br>

/// In fact, there are a few more dependent clauses that express causes and reasons.

/// It may be useful, at this point, to know that the clausal conjunction ので may also be used to connect the cause-dependent clause and the main clause.

<br>

昨日、私は病気だったので、授業を休みました。//I was sick yesterday, so I didn’t go to class.

<br>

/// In most cases, から and ので are interchangeable, but there are some differences;

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Temporal Adverbial Clauses

### (1) Temporal adverbial clauses joined by 時 {とき}

/// a time condition may be expressed by an adverbial clause joined by the conjunction 時.

<br>

#### Predicate aspectual forms before the conjunction 時 {とき}

/// The following example uses the sentential conjunction その時:

<br>

明日、私は森さんに会います。ぞの時に、私達は日本語で話します。//I’ll meet Mori-san tomorrow. At that time, we’ll speak in Japanese.

<br>

/// The two sentences above may be changed into a complex sentence by using 時 as the clausal conjunction

<br>

明日、私が森さんに会った時に、私は日本語で話します。//When I meet Mori-san tomorrow, we’ll speak in Japanese.

<br>

/// In the sentence above, the verb is in the perfective form, 会った {あった}, despite the fact that the speaker has not met Mori-san yet, because the speaker intends to speak to Mori-san after the act of meeting has taken place.

/// Remember, the perfective form indicates only the completion of an event, not the past tense.

<br>

#### Stative predicates in the adverbial clauses

/// When the predicate in an adverbial clause is stative in nature, its form does not change, regardless of the form in the main clause.

<br>

寒い時、コートを着ます。//I wear a coat when it’s cold.

寒い時、コートを着ました。//I wore a coat when it was cold.

<br>

#### Aspectual forms in adverbial clauses

/// The aspectual forms of movement verbs illustrate the imperfective and perfective aspects clearly, regardless of the time of the event. In the examples below, imagine a situation that includes the following two events:

### (1) going to Japan from America; and (2) buying a dictionary.

<br>

/// In all cases, the aspectual form of the predicate in the main clause is what indicates whether both events have taken place or not.

/// There are four possible situations:

<br>

日本に行く時、辞書を買います。//I will buy a dictionary before going to Japan.

日本に行った時、辞書を買います。//I will buy a dictionary in Japan after I arrive there.

日本に行く時、辞書を買いました。//I bought a dictionary before I arrived in Japan.

日本に行った時、辞書を買いました。//I bought a dictionary in Japan after I arrived there.

<br>

### (2) Temporal adverbial clauses joined by 前 {まえ}

/// the plain positive imperfective must be used before 前に, as the time condition indicates that the action in the adverbial clause is incomplete when the action in the main clause takes or has taken place.

/// This is true regardless of the time the sentence expresses in the main predicate.

<br>

ルームメートが１０時に寝る前に、私はテレビを見ます。//I’ll watch TV before my roommate goes to bed at 10:00.

ルームメートが１０時に寝る前に、私はテレビを見ました。//I watched TV before my roommate went to bed at 10:00.

<br>

### (3) Temporal adverbial clauses joined by 後 {あと}

/// Similarly, the plain positive perfective form must be used before 後で, as the adverbial clause indicates an action completed before the action in the main clause takes or has taken place.

/// This is true regardless of the time of the sentence shows in the main predicate.

<br>

ルームメートが１０時に寝た後で、私はテレビを見ます。//I’ll watch TV after my roommate goes to bed at 10:00.

ルームメートが１０時に寝た後で、私はテレビを見ました。//I watched TV after my roommate went to bed at 10:00.

<br>

### (4) Use of 前 {まえ} and 後 {あと} with numbers

/// 前 and 後 can be used immediately after numbers that indicate time.

<br>

三年前に日本に行きました。//I went to Japan three years ago.

三年後で日本に行きました。//I went to Japan three years later.

三年後に日本に行きました。//I went to Japan three years later.

<br>

/// 三年後 may be pronounced either さんねんあと or さんねんご.

/// The pronunciation of the kanji 後 depends on whether the particle に or で is used.

/// If で is used, the phrase is pronounced さんねんあと; if に is used, it is pronounced さんねんご.

/// The particle に is optional after 三年前 and 三年後 {さんねんご}, but で must follow 三年後 {さんねんあと}.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Situational Adverbial Clauses Joined by the たら-forms

### (1) たら-forms

/// Adverbial clauses that indicate conditions of time are often expressed in English with “when” and “if.”

/// It is important for the students not to try to correlate the words “when” and “if” directly to specific structures in Japanese.

/// Rather, it is more important to understand the basic meanings that these Japanese structures express.

/// There are quite a few adverbial clauses that express time-related conditions.

/// In this section, one such adverbial clause will be introduced.

/// This is called the たら adverbial clause because its predicate ends with ~たら.

<br>

/// For now, the 時 {とき}and たら adverbial clauses are distinguished as follows:

/// the condition expressed in the 時 adverbial clause is temporal (“at the time when”), while the condition in the たら adverbial clause is situational (“if and when the situation is such-and-such”).

<br>

/// The rules to derive the たら-forms are quite simple: just add ~ら to the ending of the perfective form ~た or ~だ.

/// Verbal: Perfective form + ら

/// Adjectival: ~い → ~かったら

/// Nominal (copula): だ → だったら

/// Negative predicate: ~ない → ~なかったら

<br>

### (2) When the predicate of the main clause is in the imperfective form

/// The たら-form can be used to express a situational condition under which a certain outcome will occur.

/// In this case, the main clause is always in the imperfective form.

<br>

日本に行ったら、日本語が上手に成ると思います。//If you go to Japan, I believe your Japanese will improve.

車がもっと安かったら、買います。//If cars were cheaper, I would buy one.

あの部屋が静かだったら、あそこで勉強します。//If that room is quiet, I will study there.

<br>

### (3) When the predicate of the main clause is in the perfective form

/// The たら-form in the adverbial clause can also indicate circumstances under which an unexpected event occurred.

/// In this case, the predicate form in the main clause is always perfective.

<br>

家に帰ったら、母が来ていました。//To my surprise, when I returned home, my mother was there.

クラスに行ったら、だれもいませんでした。//To my surprise, when I went to class, no one was there.

<br>

### (4) Difference between the たら-adverbial and the とき-adverbial

/// The main difference between sentences with adverbial clauses using 時 {とき}and those using ~たら is that with 時, the focus of the sentence is when the event expressed in the main clause happened or will happen.

/// With ~たら, on the other hand, sentence focuses on what happened or will happen under the situation expressed in the ~たら clause.

<br>

/// Compare the two responses to the following question:

<br>

いつ聞きましょうか。//When shall we ask him?

<br>

林さんが来た時に、聞きましょう。//Let’s ask Hayashi-san when he gets here.

林さんが来たら、聞きましょう。//If Hayashi-san comes, let’s ask him.

<br>

/// The difference between the adverbial clauses above is that,

/// with the 時-adverbial, the speaker knows that Hayashi-san will arrive at some point;

/// with the たら-adverbial, Hayashi-san’s arrival is uncertain.

<br>

/// When the speaker is not certain that the conditions given will be met, the use of the たら-adverbial is more appropriate than the 時-adverbial.

<br>

林さんが来たら、どうしましょうか。//What should we do if Hayashi-san comes here?

<br>

/// 時 {とき}-adverbial clauses may not be used when the consequence expressed in the main clause is not controllable.

/// 困る {こまる} means “to be in trouble.”

<br>

林さんが来たら、困ります。//I’ll be in trouble if Hayashi-san comes here.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Situational Adverbial Clauses Joined by と

/// Another example of situational adverbial clauses is a construction in which the adverbial and main clauses are joined by the conditional conjunction と.

/// In this construction, the predicate preceding the conjunction と must be in the imperfective form.

<br>

### (1) When the predicate of the main clause is in the imperfective form

#### Natural consequences

/// When the predicate of the main clause is in the imperfective form, the sentence expresses the natural consequence of the situation described in the adverbial clause.

/// In these cases, the consequence is something that the speaker has no control over; it occurs naturally.

<br>

春に成ると、暖かく成ります。//Once spring comes, it will get warmer.

もっと漢字を勉強すると、日本語は易しく成ります。//Once you study more kanji, Japanese will get easier.

<br>

#### Habitual consequences

/// “Natural consequences” and “habitual consequences” are related,

/// but habitual consequences usually concern personal and controllable events rather than a natural, uncontrollable outcome.

<br>

/// This construction indicates that every time the event described in the adverbial clause occurs, the speaker or the topic does what is expressed in the main clause.

<br>

日本に行くと、井上さんに会います。//Whenever I go to Japan, I see Inoue-san.

クラスが終わると、いつも図書館で宿題をします。//After class, I always do my homework in the library.

<br>

### (2) When the predicate of the main clause is in the perfective form

/// When the predicate of the main clause is in the perfective form in this construction, it expresses an event occurring immediately after the situation described in the adverbial clause.

/// The adverb すぐ（に） “immediately” often accompanies the main clause.

<br>

家に帰ると、友達から電話がありました。//As soon as I returned home, I got a phone call from a friend.

朝ご飯を食べると、すぐ大学に行きました。//As soon as I ate breakfast, I went to college.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Representative Expressions

/// the particle や is used to indicate that items in addition to those mentioned are included in the sentence.

/// For instance, the phrase 本やペン indicates that the speaker is implying that there are more than just books and pens.

/// However,や may not be used to list predicates.

<br>

/// To list predicates, the speaker must use the たり-form (also called the representative form), with the verb する used in the final position of the sentence.

/// This is called the representative form because it is used when the speaker chooses to mention a few representative events out of many that could be listed.

<br>

/// As with the て-form, the たり-form alone does not make a meaningful grammatical sentence.

/// In the most common structure, the actions or the descriptions made with the たり-form must be concluded with the verb する.

/// The meaning of the sentence with the representative form, however, will differ depending upon the type of the predicate.

<br>

### (1) たり-formation (representative form)

/// To create the representative form, add り to the perfective form of the predicate.

<br>

### (2) Verbal predicates

/// The following exchange shows how ~たり is used in conversation:

<br>

昨日、何をしましたか。//What did you do yesterday?

昨日、料理したり、映画に行ったりしました。//I cooked, and went to a movie—things like that.

<br>

/// The たり-form is used twice within the response above.

/// It is common, though not obligatory, to use the たり-form twice.

/// Sometimes it is only used once; at other times, it may be used more than twice.

<br>

/// Note that the たり-form, like the conjunctive form, does not convey aspect.

/// Aspect is always indicated by the final verb, する. In the example above, the final verb is in the perfective form.

/// In the following examples, the main clauses are in the imperfective form and in the command construction.

<br>

明日、料理したり、映画に行ったりします。//Tomorrow I will cook, and go to the movies, and do other things like that.

土曜日には、料理したり、映画に行ったりしてください。//Please cook, and go to the movies, and do other things like that on Saturday.

<br>

### (3) Adjectival predicates

/// Since the primary function of adjectives is to describe, the たり-forms of adjectives with the verb する in a sentence are used to give different descriptions for different times.

<br>

日本語のテストは難しかったり、易しかったりします。//Sometimes Japanese exams are difficult and sometimes they’re easy.

この店のケーキは美味しかったり、美味しくなかったりです。//Cakes at this store sometimes taste great, but sometimes they’re not so good.

<br>

/// The copula in the second sentence functions to abbreviate the predicate with する.

/// This construction is commonly used.

<br>

/// When different descriptions apply to different things or people, they do not necessarily refer to different times:

<br>

この学校の先生は優しかったり、優しくなかったりします。//Some teachers at this school are lenient and some are not.

<br>

### (4) Nominal predicates

/// The function of the たり-form of the copula is the same as that of the adjective.

/// The following examples illustrate the different aspects of the final verb する.

<br>

今年の日本語のテストの日は月曜日だったり火曜日だったりしています。//The day of this year’s Japanese tests has sometimes been Monday and sometimes Tuesday.

今年の日本語のテストの日は月曜日だったり火曜日だったりします。//The day of this year’s Japanese tests is sometimes Monday and sometimes Tuesday.

<br>



/// The difference between しています and します at the end of the above two sentences is aspectual.

/// しています implies the current situation while します implies a general description of the testing situation.

<br>

/// The example below is somewhat ambiguous:

<br>

日本語の先生はアメリカ人の先生だったり日本人の先生だったりです。//Some of the Japanese teachers are American, and some are Japanese.

<br>

/// Though the translation above is the most likely interpretation, this sentence could also be read as “Sometimes an American teacher comes to the Japanese class, and at other times it’s a Japanese teacher.”

/// The meaning in such cases depends on the context.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 6: Conjunctions

### (1) Clausal conjunction し

/// The conjunction し is used between two independent clauses.

/// The function of this conjunction is to add information, much like そして, except that it is used between clauses rather than sentences.

<br>

あの人は、頭もいいし、顔もきれいですね。//That person is not only smart, but she also has a very pretty face.

<br>

/// Like けれども, the form of the first clause can be either in the plain form or the polite form when the predicate of the second clause is in the polite form.

<br>

あの人は、頭もいいし、顔もきれいだし、私は大好きです。//I like her a lot because she is smart and pretty.

あの人は、頭もいいですし、顔もきれいですし、私は大好きです。//I like her a lot because she is smart and pretty.

<br>

/// As the sentences above indicate, し may be used as a conjunction after an adverbial clause giving the reason for the statement made in the main clause.

<br>

### (2) Sentential conjunction その上 {そのうえ}

/// The conjunction その上 is sentential rather than clausal.

/// The second sentence gives additional information.

<br>

あの人は本当に頭がいいです。その上、顔もきれいです。//That person is really smart. On top of that, she’s pretty, too.

<br>

### (3) Sentential conjunctions すると and そしたら（そうしたら）

/// と and ~たら used in sentences in this chapter may also be used as independent sentential conjunctions in the forms すると and そしたら（そうしたら）.

/// When they are used to join sentences, these conjunctions function the same as と and ~たら used for adverbial clauses.

<br>

/// Recall that when と is used between an adverbial clause and the main clause with a perfective predicate, the event in the main clause is immediate.

<br>

部屋に入った。すると、電話が鳴った。//I entered the room. Immediately after that, the phone rang.

<br>

/// ~たら in the adverbial clause expresses that the event indicated in the main clause is unexpected.

/// In this case, the predicate in the main clause must be in the perfective form.

/// The sentential conjunction そしたら expresses this nuance.

/// そしたら is used more like a clause, meaning something like “after doing that, to my surprise...”

<br>

病気で学校を休んだ。そしたら、先生から電話があった。//I was sick, so I didn’t go to school. My teacher surprised me by calling me on the phone because I was absent.

妹にケーキを上げた。そしたら、妹は泣いた。//I gave my sister a piece of cake. She surprised me by bursting into tears in response.

<br>

#### More conjunctions

/// Other conjunctions may be necessary to express certain things; 

<br>



ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Giving a suggestion

<br>

さっきね、うちに帰ったら、姉から電話があったんですよ。明日、帰るって。//My sister suddenly called me when I got home. She said she’s coming home tomorrow.

へえ、何かあったんですか。//Really? Did something happen?

別にたいしたことないと思うんですけどね。//I don’t think it’s anything serious.

でも、もう一度、電話してあげたら、どうですか。//But maybe you should call her again, don’t you think?

<br>

#### さっきね

/// The use of ね after a word or a phrase is a device to confirm that the addressee understands what is being said.

/// In conversation it is used often, even within the same sentence.

<br>

#### 別にたいしたことない

/// The adverb 別に {べつに}, which must accompany a negative predicate, means “not particularly.”

<br>

これは別に美味しくありません。//This is not especially tasty.

<br>

/// たいしたことない is an idiomatic phrase meaning “nothing serious” or “not a big deal.”

<br>

#### 電話してあげる

/// あげる, one of the verbs of giving, is combined with the verb 電話する {でんわする} to mean, in the above context, “call your sister to see if everything is all right.” This structure will be covered in detail in the next chapter.

<br>

#### ~たらどうですか

/// This construction is used to make a suggestion.

<br>

友達と一緒に勉強したら、どうですか。//Why don’t you study with a friend?

<br>

### (2) Not feeling well

<br>

昨日、姉に電話したら、ちょっと具合が悪いから、帰りたいって。//When I called my sister yesterday, she said she wanted to come home because she wasn’t feeling well.

やっぱり。何でもないと、いいですね。//I thought so. I hope it’s nothing serious.

<br>

#### 具合が悪い {ぐあい が わるい}

/// 具合 {ぐあい} is a noun that means “condition” or “situation.”

/// This noun can be used for a thing (such as a machine) or a person.

/// When it is used for a person, it usually refers to their health.

/// Therefore, 具合が悪い, when discussing a person, means they are “not feeling well” or are “feeling sick.”

<br>

#### 何でもない {なんでもない}

/// This phrase means “nothing serious.”

<br>

/// といいです expresses the speaker’s wish for a certain situation.

<br>

### (3) I’m sorry to do this, but…

<br>

もう、行く準備できた？//Are you ready to go?

わるいけど、もうちょっとだけ待ってくれない？//Sorry, but can you wait for me a little longer?

間に会わないと、困るんです。しかられますから。//I don’t want to be late—I’ll really be in trouble.

じゃ、先に行ってて。//OK, then go ahead.

じゃ、申し訳ないけど、さきに行ってるね。//Sorry, but I think I should go now.

<br>

#### わるいけど

/// This expression can be used when the speaker feels guilty about asking a favor of the addressee.

/// It means “I’m really sorry, but...”

<br>

#### 待ってくれない？ (まってくれない？)

/// This is a casual way of asking 待ってくださいませんか.

<br>

#### と困る {こまる}

/// This expression is used to refer to an undesirable situation, the exact nature of which is, to the speaker, somewhat uncertain.

<br>

/// 先生が日本人だと困るんですが・・・

/// “We won’t be happy if the teacher is Japanese.”

/// [Literally, “If the teacher is Japanese, we’ll be in trouble.”]

<br>

/// しかられる is the passive verb of the base verb 叱る {しかる} “to scold.” See Stages 1–9 and 2–4 for further explanation of passive forms.

<br>

#### 先に行く

/// 先に {さきに} is a time adverb meaning “beforehand.”

/// Therefore, 先に行く means “to go before another person.”

/// 行ってて here is the same as 行っていて.

<br>

#### 申し訳ないけど {もう し わけ ないけど}

/// 申し訳ないけど is a more polite version of わるいけど.

/// Even in a casual conversation, a speaker can use 申し訳ないけど, an expression equivalent to “I am truly sorry.”

/// The use of a more humble expression conveys the depth of the speaker’s regret.

/// The polite predicate ありません instead of ない may also be used to make the expression more polite: 申し訳ありませんが.

/// The conjunction が is more formal than the colloquial けど.stage ２，４。

# Stage 2-4 Derived Verbs: Potentials and Passives

<br>

## 1: Potential Verbs and Sentences

### (1) Derived verbs

/// the three types of derived verbs include potential, passive, and causative verbs.

<br>

### (2) Potential verbs

/// When potential verbs were introduced as independent verbs, only their ability-related meaning was given.

/// however, potential verbs can also express possibility (that is, something that is possible in some situations).

<br>

#### Ability-related meaning

/// The following sentences express the topic’s ability to do something.

<br>

クリスさんは日本語が上手に話せます。//Kurisu-san can speak Japanese well.

私は運転できません。//I cannot drive.

<br>

#### Possibility-related meaning

/// Some verbs that do not involve skill or action indicate only possibility, not ability.

<br>

明日は日本語の授業に行けません。//I cannot go to Japanese class tomorrow.

ナンシーさんは明日から図書館でアルバイトできます。//It will be possible for Nancy to work at the library starting tomorrow.

日本に三週間いられます。//I can stay in Japan for three weeks.

<br>

/// Derived potential forms of action verbs have both ability- and possibility-related meanings depending on the context.

/// For instance, the potential verb 話せる may be used for both meanings. (See above for the ability-related meaning with this verb.)

/// As for the possibility-related meaning with the potential forms of action verbs, the topic is often not explicitly expressed.

<br>

この店では日本語が話せます。//In this store, we can speak Japanese.

<br>

#### Expressing possibility-related meaning with かもしれない

/// Some semi-transitive verbs, such as 分かる and ある, have no potential forms because this type of verb does not refer to an action, and thus cannot express ability.

/// Other constructions must be used to express the idea of possibility with these verbs.

<br>

/// One construction that can be used to express possibility with these verbs is the sentence-ending expression かもしれない.

<br>

あの人はお金がたくさんあるかもしれません。//It’s possible that that person has a lot of money.

あの人は日本語が分かるかもしれません。//It’s possible that that person understands Japanese.

<br>

/// When the speaker wants to express more certainty that the situation is true, the volitional copula だろう may be used.

<br>

あの人はお金がたくさんあるでしょう。//I’m quite certain that that person has a lot of money.

あの人は日本語が分かるでしょう。//I’m sure that that person understands Japanese.

<br>

/// In either case, the possibilities expressed by the potential forms and those expressed by かもしれな い or だろう are not quite parallel to each other.

<br>

/// With the potential form, the possibility lies in whether or not the topic is able to carry out the action.

/// When かもしれない or だろう are used, the possibility lies in whether or not the situation is true, with somewhat different degrees of uncertainty.

/// For this reason, both かもしれない and だろう may be used even with potential verbs.

<br>

あの店では日本語が話せるかもしれません。//You may be able to speak Japanese at that store.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Passive Verbs and Sentences

### (1) Passive verb formation

/// Group 1, 2: Change the final vowel u to the vowel a and add れる

/// Group 3: [する → される], [くる → こられる]

<br>

/// all derived passive forms are Group 1 verbs.

<br>

### (2) Different passive sentences in Japanese

/// In both English and Japanese, passive sentences appear more often in formal writing than in casual speech.

<br>

/// In Japanese, there are two different kinds of passive sentences.

/// - One is a regular passive, used most often in formal writing or speech.

/// - The other is a passive expressing that the speaker has been affected by a certain event, resulting in a feeling that is often undesirable.

/// This type of passive, which is used rather frequently in daily conversation, is called the affective passive.

/// Because this type of passive is emotive, the topic is normally the speaker.

<br>

### (3) Regular passive sentences

/// The use of regular passives occurs most often in written work such as essays, or in formal speech.

/// The topic of the essay is often used as the topic of passive sentences.

/// For instance, if an essay is discussing 日本語, 日本語 may be used as the topic of the essay’s opening statement.

<br>

日本語は日本でだけ話されています。//Japanese is spoken only in Japan.

<br>

/// Regular passives do have active counterparts

<br>

この大学では、多くの学生が日本語を勉強しています。//Many students study Japanese at this college.

この大学では、日本語は多くの学生に勉強されています。//At this college, Japanese is studied by many students.

<br>

/// The particle に is used to mark the person who does the action in a regular passive sentence.

/// によって instead of に can also be used in some cases.

<br>

この本は有名な作家に書かれました。//This book was written by a famous writer.

この本は有名な作家によって書かれました。//This book was written by a famous writer.

<br>

/// While the particle に and によって may mark the person who acts, に is the particle used for all types of passive predicates.

/// によって is not used for the verbs that have emotive meanings, such as scolding and praising, as shown in the incorrect sentence below.

/// In cases when both に and によって are acceptable, the use of によって sounds more formal than に.

<br>

日本の生徒は先生に時々、叱られます。//Students in Japan are occasionally scolded by their teachers.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Affective passive sentences

/// In English, because passive sentences are formed by making the object of the active sentence into the subject of the passive sentence, only transitive sentences can be converted into passive sentences.

<br>

/// In Japanese, passive verbs can also be used in sentences in which the speaker expresses an emotional response to an event.

/// Feelings such as annoyance or surprise can be conveyed by the use of passive verbs.

/// In this type of passive sentence, even intransitive action verbs may be used in some situations.

/// However, semi-transitive verbs, and the intransitive counterpart of a transitive-intransitive verb pair (such as the intransitive, 始まる {はじまる}, whose transitive counterpart is 始める {はじめる})

/// may not be used even in affective passives.

<br>

/// The structures of the regular passive and affective passive are inherently different.

/// In affective passives, the person who is affected—again, most often the speaker—is the topic of the sentence.

/// Unlike regular passive sentences, the topic of the affective passive does not appear in the active counterpart

<br>

/// Active:

<br>

雨がふりました。//It rained.

<br>

/// Passive:

<br>

私は雨に降られました。//I was affected by the fact that rain fell.

<br>



去年、私達は犬に死なれました。//Last year, we were saddened by the death of our dog.

私は映画館で子供に泣かれました。//I was really annoyed by the child’s crying in the theater.

私は先生に私の家に来られました。//I was shocked that my teacher came to my house.

<br>

/// The sentences above are translated idiomatically, as there is really no way to provide word-for-word translations for sentences of this type.

<br>

/// Unlike a regular passive, when a transitive sentence is converted into an affective passive, the direct object in the active sentence remains the direct object in the affective passive.

/// The person affected by the event is the topic, and does not appear in the active sentence.

<br>

/// Active:

<br>

友達はボーイフレンドからの手紙を読みました。//My friend read my boyfriend’s letter.

<br>

/// Passive:

<br>

私は友達にボーイフレンドからの手紙を読まれました。//I was upset that my friend read my boyfriend's letter.

<br>

/// In many affective passive sentences, the topic is not mentioned, because it is clear that the speaker is the one who is emotionally affected.

<br>

/// Some passives are affective passives by nature, even though they have the structure of a regular passive, because of the inherent meaning of the verb.

/// This is particularly true of emotive verbs.

<br>

/// Active:

<br>

先生は私を叱りました。//The teacher scolded me.

<br>

/// Passive:

<br>

私は先生に叱られました。//I was upset about being scolded by the teacher.

<br>

#### Affective passives with ~てしまう

/// ~てしまう is often used with the affective passives.

/// Recall that ~てしまう may be used to express a certain unexpected and unintentional result.

/// As the circumstances in which affective passives are used are by nature unexpected, this resultative expression is commonly used in affective passive sentences.

<br>

昨日、先生に叱られてしまいました。//I ended up being scolded by the teacher.

卒業式で雨に降られてしまいました。//It turned out that it rained at the graduation ceremony.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (5) Passive and potential sentences

/// In terms of their formation, the passive and potential forms of Group 1 verbs and 来る {くる} are identical.

/// The two forms are used in different structures, however, so the meanings of each are clear.

<br>

このケーキが食べられますか。//Can you eat this cake?

私は妹にケーキを食べられました。//I was upset that my sister ate my cake.

<br>

/// Unlike Group 1 verbs, potentials and passives of the Group 2 verbs and する have different forms.

<br>

ここで日本語が話せます。//We can speak Japanese here.

日本語はここでも話されています。//Japanese is spoken even here.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (6) Passives in English and Japanese

/// When the speaker receives some kind of benefit, the use of a passive sentence is not appropriate in Japanese.

<br>

/// It is allowed in English, however, as in the following example:

/// - Japanese is taught by Professor Tanaka.

/// - I was taught Japanese by Professor Tanaka.

/// The second sentence cannot be expressed as a passive sentence in Japanese, because the implication is that the topic is receiving some kind of benefit or favor from Professor Tanaka.

<br>

/// To express this meaning, the following structure must be used:

<br>

私は田中先生に日本語を教えていただきました。//I was taught Japanese by Tanaka-sensei.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: て-forms with Giving and Receiving Verbs

/// All verbs of giving and receiving may be combined with other verbs in the て-form.

/// In these cases, what the topic gives and receives are the benefits of actions rather than things.

/// The central meaning of this construction is therefore “doing a favor for or receiving a favor from another individual.”

/// In English, this nuance is expressed by the preposition “for,” as in “I read the book for the child,” or “Mary made the cake for me.” 

<br>

### (1) ~てあげる（さしあげる・やる）

/// This construction indicates that the topic does a favor for another person.

/// The use of あげる, さしあげる, and やる depends on the relationship between the topic and the recipient of the favor.

<br>

私は母に英語の手紙を読んであげました。//I read the letter in English for my mother.

私は友達のおばあさんに新聞を読んでさしあげました。//I read the newspaper for my friend’s grandmother.

私は弟の宿題をしてやりました。//I did my younger brother’s homework for him.

<br>

/// This construction should be used with care, because when a speaker talks about doing a favor for others, it can seem boastful in the context of Japanese culture.

/// The topic may do something for someone voluntarily, or at the request of the receiver; it is not always clear which is the case.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) ~てくれる（くださる）

/// When the verbs くれる or くださる are used, the recipient is always the speaker or the speaker’s うちgroup.

/// The particle が is often used as the topic marker in this type of sentence because the sentence often expresses who is the person who has offered or will offer the favor.

<br>

ルームメートがこの漢字を教えてくれました。//My roommate is the one who taught me this kanji.

伊藤先生がこの漢字を教えてくださいました。//Ito-sensei is the one who taught me this kanji.

時雨さんが弟に本を読んでくれました。//Shigure-sensei is the one who taught me this kanji.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) ~てもらう（いただく）

/// This construction is used when the topic receives a favor from someone else,

/// most often as the result of a request or in a prearranged situation.

<br>

僕はルームメートにこの漢字を教えてもらいました。//I had my roommate teach me this kanji.

マイクさんは鈴木先生にこの漢字を教えていただきました。//Mike asked Professor Suzuki to teach him this kanji.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Comparison between ~てくれる and ~てもらう

/// The following is a summary of the different situations in which ~てくれる（くださる） and ~てもらう（いただく） may be used.

/// In both of the sentences below, Taro, a man, read the letter for the speaker:

<br>

太郎さんが日本語の手紙を読んでくれました。//Taro read the Japanese letter for me.

私は日本語の手紙を太郎さんに読んでもらいました。//I had Taro read the Japanese letter for me.

<br>

/// The person who did the action of reading the letter is in the topic position in the sentence with ~くれる（くださる）.

/// In contrast, the person who has asked and received the favor is the topic in the sentence with ~もらう（いただく）.

<br>

/// In the first sentence with ~くれる（くださる）, the focus is Taro, who has offered the action of reading.

/// This action may have taken place because the speaker has asked Taro to do so, or Taro may have volunteered (the use of が for the topic indicates the latter).

<br>

/// In the second sentence with ~もらう（いただく）, the speaker asked Taro to read the letter, perhaps because the speaker cannot read Japanese.

/// As a result of this request, the speaker (the topic) received Taro’s help, namely, the reading of the letter.

/// In this case, the speaker is the topic, since the speaker initiated the asking, and the sentence is structured to communicate this fact.

/// This construction is generally used to talk about a favor that the speaker has received as the result of his or her own request.

<br>

#### Causative sentences and ~てもらう（いただく）

/// causative verbs can be used in sentences in which one person makes another do something.

/// This may seem similar to the sentences with ~てもらう（いただく）.

/// The difference is that the topic of a causative sentence is usually someone who has a certain authority over the person whom the topic makes do something; this is not the case with sentences with ~てもらう （いただく）.

/// Another difference is that sentences with ~てもらう（いただく） imply that the topic has requested that another do something, while causative sentences do not imply any such request.

<br>

先生は学生に漢字を書かせました。//The teacher made the students write kanji.

先生は学生に漢字を書いてもらいました。//The teacher had a student write kanji for him.

<br>

#### Noun のために

/// This phrase, a noun with のために, is used to indicate the recipient of a favor in some constructions.

/// ために, rather than に, is used to avoid confusion as to whether the destination or the beneficiary is being named.

<br>

/// Suppose the speaker’s grandmother is ill, so she cannot go shopping.

/// In this situation, the grandmother is the beneficiary on whose behalf the speaker is going to the store.

<br>

/// It is better to use ために in place of the first に:

<br>

私は叔母さんのために店に行ってあげました。//I went to the store for my grandmother.

<br>

/// ために may also be used in cases when に is normally used to indicate the beneficiary of the topic’s action.

/// When both ために and に are possible, the benefit is much more greatly emphasized with た めに than に.

/// Because of this, an inappropriate use of ために may convey the nuance that the gift was overbearing.

<br>

私はおばあさんのためにおいしいケーキを作ってあげました。//I made a great cake for my grandmother.

<br>

## 4: て-forms for Expressing the Cause

### (1) Different causes

/// Up to this point in the course, only the adverbial clause with the conjunction から has been introduced to express cause.

/// Clauses with ので also express cause.

/// Another way to express cause is to end the first clause with the て-form.

/// This indicates that the first clause is the reason for the result expressed in the second clause.

/// The distinction in this construction is that the result occurs naturally, rather than being a result of the speaker’s action:

<br>

漢字が難しくて、私はこの本が読めません。//I can’t read this book because the kanji are too difficult.

<br>

/// Emotive expressions, such as the verb 困る {こまる} in the following sentence, are often used in the result clause:

<br>

雨が降って、困りました。//It rained, and that caused me some problems.

<br>

### (2) Apologizing

/// Ending the first clause with the て-form is a construction commonly used to form an apology:

<br>

昨日、授業に来なくて、すみません （でした）。//I’m sorry I didn’t come to class yesterday.

<br>

/// A very common mistake when expressing an apology is to connect the two clauses with the conjunction から (or ので)

<br>

/// An apology is best connected with the て-form because it indicates that the speaker’s regret emerges naturally, rather than being the chosen consequence of a causal event.

<br>

### (3) Thanking

/// If the speaker is thanking someone for a specific thing that he or she received, を is used, though it may be deleted in casual conversation:

<br>

面白い本をありがとうございます。//Thank you for the interesting book.

<br>

/// When a speaker thanks someone else, it is because that person has done something nice for him or her.

/// It is therefore most natural that, following the main clause, the first clause contains some kind of giving or receiving verb.

/// Without this, the expression is often inappropriate.

<br>

手伝ってくれて、ありがとう。//Thank you for helping me.

<br>

/// The following is a more polite version of the above sentence; the verb くださる is used rather than く れる, with ございます added at the end.

<br>

手伝ってくださって、ありがとうございます。//Thank you for helping me.

<br>

/// Mistakes commonly made when expressing appreciation include 

/// 1. not using a verb of giving or receiving;

/// 2. joining the first clause to the second clause by から (or ので);

/// 3. using a form other than the て-form in the first clause.

<br>

### (1) Thanking someone for advice

<br>

今日も授業で皆に笑われたんです。//People laughed at me again today in class.

ええ？ そうなんですか。どうしたんですか。//Really? Tell me what happened.

全然、知りませんでした。教えてくださって、本当にありがとうございます。//I didn’t know that at all. Thank you very much for telling me.

<br>

#### どうしたんですか

/// the use of ~んですか suggests that the speaker is urging or encouraging the addressee to explain the situation.

<br>

### (2) How did you get here?

<br>

どうやってここまで来られたんですか。//How did you manage to get here?

父に乗せてもらって来たんです。//I asked my father to give me a ride.

<br>

#### どうやって

/// やって in this phrase is from the verb やる “to do,” a colloquial verb equivalent in meaning to する.

/// どうやって is a way of asking how things are done.

<br>

#### 乗せてもらって

/// 乗せる {のせる} is a verb meaning “to give a ride.”

<br>

彼は私を車に乗せてくれた。//He gave me a ride in his car.

<br>

### (3) Feeling upset about a bad grade

<br>

中間試験、ものすごく悪い点をつけられました。//I got a really bad grade on the midterm.

勉強しなかったんですか。僕もあまりいい成績はもらいませんでした。//Was it because you didn’t study for it? I didn’t do very well, either.

一生懸命、勉強したんですが、ちょっと風邪をひいていたんです。//I studied as hard as I could, but I caught a bit of a cold.

それはいけませんね。気をつけてください。//That’s too bad [about the cold]. Please do take care.

<br>

#### 成績をつける and 点をつける

/// 成績 {せいせき} “grade” and 点 {てん} “point” are used to express the grade one receives in a course, on a test, etc.

/// The verbs used with these words are つける (for giving a grade) and もらう (for receiving one).

<br>

/// 一生懸命 {いっしょうけんめい} is used with the particle に, though the particle may be deleted in casual conversation.

/// The phrase means that one does something “as hard as one possibly can.”

/// 一所懸命 (i.e., the second kanji pronounced with a short しょ) is also commonly used.

<br>

#### 気をつける

/// There are quite a few idiomatic phrases with the noun 気 {き}, “spirit; mind; heart.”

/// 気をつける indicates that a person pays attention to things, or is careful about certain things.

/// The thing that the topic pays attention to is marked by に.

<br>

車に気をつけてください。//Watch out for cars, please.stage ２，５。

# Stage 2-5 Stems and Their Uses

## 1: Nominal Elements of Stems

### (1) About stems

#### Stem formation

/// To review the rules for deriving stems from base forms, see Stage 1–9.

<br>

#### The polite form as an example

/// See Stage 1–9 for information on the formation of polite forms with stems.

<br>

### (2) Stems as nouns

/// When used alone, a stem may function as a noun, although not all stems can be used as nouns.

/// The following examples are typical:

/// Base form: 話す Stem: 話 {はなし} Meaning as a noun: story; talk

/// Base form: 休む Stem: 休み {やすみ} Meaning as a noun: vacation; time off

/// Base form: 読む Stem: 読み {よみ} Meaning as a noun: reading

<br>

あの先生の話はいつも面白いです。//That teacher’s stories are always interesting.

明日、日本語の授業は休みです。//There will be no Japanese class tomorrow.

この漢字は音読みが二つと訓読みが一つあります。//This kanji has two on-readings and one kun-reading.

<br>

/// Please note that a stem used as a noun is different from a nominalized verb.

/// A nominalized verb with こと or の still maintains a verbal meaning, while a stem used as a noun does not.

/// Compare the following two sentences.

<br>

大学の夏休みは長いですねえ。//The college summer vacation is long, isn’t it?

忙しい時に、時々、休むことは大切です。//It’s important to rest sometimes when things are busy.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Stems used to describe the weather

/// Weather may be described by using nouns such as 雨 {あめ} and 雪 {ゆき}, as shown below:

<br>

今日は雨です。//It is rainy today.

明日は雪です。//It will snow tomorrow.

<br>

/// To describe clear and cloudy days, it is common to use the stems of the relevant verbs in the predicate position.

/// 晴れる {はれる} is a verb meaning “to clear up.” 晴れ {はれ} is the stem of this verb.

<br>

今日は晴れです。//It is sunny today.

<br>

/// Likewise, 曇る {くもる} is a verb that means “to become cloudy.” 曇り {くもり} is the stem of this verb.

<br>

今日は曇りです。//It is cloudy today.

<br>

/// The following formulaic expression is often used by weather forecasters, and may be heard in weather reports.

/// It is good to know this expression in order to understand TV or radio broadcasts, but there is no need to use it to describe the weather in conversation.

/// 後 {のち}, a rather formal word, means “later.”

<br>

今日は、晴れ、後、曇りです。//It will be clear at first and then cloud over later today.

<br>

/// In conversation, 後で {あとで} “at a later time,” with the optional で, may be used rather than 後 {のち}:

<br>

今日は、晴れで、その後（で）、曇りになると聞きました。//I heard that today will be clear at first, and then it will cloud over.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Responding to alternative questions with verbal predicates

/// There are three possible ways to respond to an alternative question:

/// 1. choose one of the options;

/// 2. choose both options;

/// 3. negate both options.

<br>

今日、勉強しましたか、（それとも）仕事しましたか。//Did you study or work today?

<br>

/// When choosing one of the options, state that option, as in the following:

<br>

仕事しました。//I worked.

<br>

/// When choosing both, use the following structure, in which the two nouns are used in the object positions:

<br>

勉強も仕事もしました。//I studied and worked.

<br>

/// If choosing neither option, use the following structure:

<br>

勉強も仕事もしませんでした。//I didn’t study or work.

<br>

/// The verbs in the above alternative question sentence contain the same verb する.

/// The following question sentence, however, contains two different verbs:

<br>

歩きましたか、走りましたか。//Did you walk or run?

<br>

/// In this case, to negate both alternatives, use the stems (which are nouns in form) marked by も with the negative form of the verb する.

<br>

歩きも走りもしませんでした。//I neither walked nor ran.

<br>

/// For choosing or negating both options, the pronoun どちらも “both” or “neither” may be used, regardless of the verbs used in the alternative question.

/// In this case, the verb する represents all verbs.

<br>

どちらもしませんでした。//I neither walked nor ran.

どちらもしました。//I did both.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Stems with に as Purpose Phrases

### (1) Purpose particle に

/// The particle に has many functions, as has already been shown.

/// In the following phrases, に functions to express the purpose of an action:

<br>

朝ご飯にりんごを食べます。//I eat apples for breakfast.

買い物に行きます。//I’m going shopping.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Purpose of going somewhere

/// the stem of a verb is used with the purpose particle に to express a certain action as a purpose.

/// In this construction, the last verb must be a directional verb that indicates a movement from one place to another, such as coming or going somewhere, or returning home.

<br>

映画を見に行きましょう。//Let’s go see a movie.

友達に会いにこのレストランに来ました。//I came to this restaurant to meet my friend.

お昼ご飯をたたべに家に帰りました。//I went home to eat lunch.

<br>

/// When the main verb is not a directional verb, a different construction must be used, as explained in the following section.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Purpose of doing something

/// When the main verb is one that does not indicate direction, such as “studying in order to become a teacher,” or “eating to gain weight,” then the purpose of the action should be expressed by the imperfective form of the verb followed by ために.

<br>

来年、留学するために、今年、日本語を勉強しています。//I am studying Japanese this year in order to study abroad next year.

友達と話すために、電話しました。//I called my friend on the phone in order to talk to him.

<br>

/// In fact, ために can be used for all verb types, even those that indicate direction.

<br>

すしを食べるために町に行きます。//I will go to town to eat sushi.

<br>

/// When both structures are possible, the purpose expressed by ために sounds more serious.

<br>

友達に話しに行きました。//I went to have a chat with my friend.

友達に話すために行きました。//I went to discuss something with my friend.

<br>

/// When the verb preceding ために is in the perfective form, the entire sentence takes on a different meaning.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) 大和言葉 {やまとことば} and 漢語 {かんご}

/// In addition to the use of a stem as a nominal form, one may see an actual noun that consists of kanji compounds in the same construction.

/// As explained thus far, both stems and nominalized verbs function as nominal elements.

/// In addition to these two kinds of nominal elements, there is another group of nouns that consist of more than one kanji.

/// These kanji compounds are called 漢語

<br>

/// For instance, the noun 読書 {どくしょ} “reading,” is a 漢語.

/// The same meaning can be expressed by the verb 読む with the nominalizer こと, as in 読むこと.

<br>

/// In the pair of sentences below, 食べ {たべ} is derived from the verb 食べる, while the noun 食事 {しょくじ} “meal” is expressed with two kanji.

/// This kanji compound is pronounced with the on-reading:

<br>

明日、一緒に食べに行きませんか。//Would you like to eat together tomorrow?

明日、一緒に食事に行きませんか。//Would you like to eat together tomorrow?

<br>

/// In any language, there is often more than one word to refer to the same thing, event, action, state, etc.

/// In English, these similar words, if not exactly the same, may have different origins: AngloSaxon and Latin/French-based, for example.

/// In Japanese, two common sources are native words and Chinese words.

/// The native words are referred to as 大和言葉 or 和語 {わご} while words of Chinese origin are 漢語.

/// For “reading,” 読む is 大和言葉 , while the kanji compound 読書 is of Chinese origin.

<br>

/// Not all 漢語 are of Chinese origin, however.

/// For instance, the verb 食べる is 大和言葉.

/// The 漢語 equivalent is 食事する, but this 漢語 is a Japan-made noun based on the structure of the words of Chinese origin.

/// There are quite a few such 漢語.

<br>

/// Notice the differences in the readings of the kanji of these two words.

/// For most 大和言葉, 訓読み {くんよみ} is used, as in 食べる.

/// And 音読み {おんよみ} is used for most 漢語 as in 食事.

<br>

/// The difference between the two kinds of words is often one of formality.

/// 大和言葉 are used more often in everyday speech, while 漢語 sound somewhat more formal.

/// Of course, this is just a broad generalization, and there are exceptions to this statement.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Emotive Expressions

### (1) Stem with たい

/// the construction of the stem with the suffix ~たい was introduced.

<br>

明日、映画に行きたいです。//I want to go to a movie tomorrow.

<br>

#### Expressing one’s own desires

/// In Japanese culture, it is considered overly direct to express one’s own desires, so it may not be appropriate to use the たい-form by itself in some cases.

/// To avoid such directness, many speakers add the verb 思う {おもう}.

<br>

来年、日本に行きたいと思っています。//I want to go to Japan next year.

<br>

/// Since the above sentence refers to the speaker’s current feeling, 思っている {おもっている} is better than the habitual 思う {おもう}, which is generally used to express the speaker’s opinions.

<br>

/// There is no need to add 思う when negating a desire or talking about a past desire.

<br>

そんな映画は見たくありません。//I don’t want to see that kind of a movie.

ミルクが飲みたかったです。//I wanted to drink milk.

<br>

#### Other facts

/// Other important facts to remember about this construction include the following

/// - The new forms are adjectives, as the last syllable い suggests;

/// - The object should be formally marked by the particle が, but in actual conversation を is also used;

/// - This expression can be used to express the speaker’s desire, or in a question addressing a second person directly, but it may not be used to talk about a third person’s desire.

<br>

#### A third person’s emotive expressions

/// As the last point in the above list states, certain emotive expressions may not be used to describe a third person’s emotive states.

<br>

/// There are many ways to talk about a third person’s desire.

/// One is for the speaker to report what the third person said regarding his or her feelings.

<br>

マイクさんは来年、日本に行きたいと言いました。//Mike-san said that he wanted to go to Japan next year.

<br>

/// Another way is for the speaker to express his or her inference based on direct observation by using a complex predicate with ようだ.

<br>

マイクさんは来年、日本に行きたいようです。//It seems to me that Mike wants to go to Japan next year.

<br>

/// Review and further study of structures with the verbs 言う {いう} (or おっしゃる) and 思う {おもう} follows below.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) The verbs 言う and おっしゃる

/// おっしゃる is the honorific verb of the verb 言う {いう}.

/// The polite form is おっしゃいます, rather than おっしゃります, just as the polite form of いらっしゃる is いらっしゃいます, not いらっしゃります.

<br>

/// Since おっしゃる is the honorific verb of 言う, it is used when the topic is someone to whom the speaker wishes to show respect.

<br>

/// With these verbs, there are essentially two ways to report what the other has said: the speech can be reported directly, or indirectly.

<br>

#### Direct quotation

/// In reporting speech directly, the speaker repeats exactly what another person has said.

/// In the direct quote, such things as the predicate style (polite vs. plain), the predicate ending, and sentence-final particles may also be reported directly.

/// When speaking, it is really up to the speaker to choose what to include in the quote.

/// When reporting in writing, use quotation marks.

/// In horizontal writing, 「 is used to open a quote, and 」 is used to close it.

/// The direction of the quotation marks changes when writing vertically.

<br>

伊藤さんは「このケーキはおいしいですよ。」と言いました。//Ito-san said, ‘You know, this cake is delicious.’

鈴木先生は「試験は金曜日です。」とおっしゃいました。//Suzuki-sensei said, ‘The examination will be on Friday.’

<br>

#### Indirect quotation

/// In an indirect quote, a speaker’s remarks are paraphrased rather than being quoted verbatim.

/// In this case, the content of the quote is expressed in the plain form, even though the person being quoted might have used the polite form.

/// Such things as sentence-final particles are not included in the indirect quote.

<br>

ジョンさんはこのケーキはおいしいと言いました。//John said that this cake was delicious.

<br>

/// With an adjectival predicate, as above, as well as with a verbal predicate, the copula is not needed for an indirect quote.

/// When the predicate is nominal, as below, the copula is needed to indicate aspect:

<br>

伊藤先生は試験は金曜日だとおっしゃいました。//Ito-sensei said that the examination would be on Friday.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) The verb 思う

/// Both 思う {おもう} and 考える {かんがえる} are translated as “to think.”

/// However, 思う, rather than 考える, is used for stating the speaker’s own opinions or thoughts.

/// 考える is usually reserved for the problem-solving type of thinking.

<br>

/// The verb 思う is used similarly to the verb 言う.

/// however, the verb 思う, is not used to quote thoughts directly.

/// Thoughts are generally conveyed by stating their content, rather than the verbatim thoughts themselves.

<br>

/// This verb can be used when the speaker asks the addressee what he or she thinks directly, or when the speaker expresses his or her thoughts.

/// Like other emotive expressions, this verb may not be used to express a third person’s thoughts.

<br>

/// When asking for opinions, use the interrogative pronoun どう rather than 何 {なん}.

<br>

あなたはこれについてどう思いますか。//What do you think of this?

とてもいい考えだと思います。//I think it’s a very good idea.

<br>

/// When asking for specific information, 何 {なん} or 何 {なん} with an appropriate suffix may be used.

/// In this case, the question particle か is not used within the embedded question (that is, the question clause used within the sentence).

/// In the sentence below, か should not be used between the clause 何人だ and the final verb 思う.

<br>

あの人は何人だと思いますか。//What nationality do you think that person is?

あの人は日本人だと思います。//I think he’s Japanese.

<br>

/// As mentioned above, the topic of the verb 思う is always the speaker in a statement sentence, or the addressee in a question sentence.

/// This verb may not be used to report a third person’s opinion. To do this, another element such as 言う {いう} or よう may be used after the verb 思う {おもう}, as shown below.

<br>

鈴木さんはそれはいい考えだと思うと言いました。//Suzuki-san said that he thought it was a good idea.

鈴木さんはそれはいい考えだと思っているようです。//It looks to me like Suzuki-san thinks it’s a good idea.

<br>

### (4) The verb 聞く

/// The verb 聞く {きく} has two different meanings.

<br>

#### 聞く “to hear”

/// It is most common to use indirect quotation to express something that has been heard from another person.

<br>

伊藤先生の授業はとても難しいと聞きました。//I heard that Ito-sensei’s class is very difficult.

伊藤先生の授業はとても難しいということを聞きました。//I heard that Ito-sensei’s class is very difficult.

<br>

/// To convey what has been heard directly, the two verbs, 言う and 聞く, must be used in a single sentence. This type of sentence will be covered in Stage 3–1, as the important factor of direct perception must be considered.

<br>

#### 聞く “to ask”

/// There are direct as well as indirect ways to report the content of a question.

/// When reporting directly, both か in the quoted question and と, which connects the quote and the verb 聞く, are used.

/// When reporting indirectly, the question particle かoverrides the quotative particle と.

<br>

鈴木先生は僕に「何時に起きましたか。」と聞きました。//Suzuki-sensei asked me, ‘What time did you get up?’

鈴木先生は僕に何時に起きたか聞きました。//Suzuki-sensei asked me what time I got up.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Two Simultaneous Events

### (1) Stem with ながら

/// The stem of an action verb with ながら is used as an adverbial phrase to express an action that accompanies a main action, but only as performed by a single person.

<br>

私はいつも新聞を読みながら、勉強します。//I always read the newspaper while I’m studying.

<br>

/// In the sentence above, the main action—studying—is described in the main clause.

/// The other action, reading the newspaper, is the accompanying action.

<br>

/// The main action in the English sentence can be expressed after the word “while” (as in the translated sentence above).

/// In Japanese, the function of the stem with ながら is adverbial, so it must be given before the thing it modifies (the main clause).

<br>

/// Aspects such as negation and time are all expressed in the main clause.

<br>

テレビを見ながら、勉強しないでください。//Please don’t watch TV while you study.

昨日、メールを読みながら、朝ご飯を食べました。//I read my e-mail while I ate breakfast yesterday.

<br>

/// The ながら-construction has the following restrictions:

/// - The ながら-construction may not be used to express an event in which two different people do two different things simultaneously (e.g., “I always read the newspaper while my mother watches TV”).

/// - Neither verb in the ながら-construction can be a stative (non-action) verb (e.g., “I got married while I was in Japan”).

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) The clausal conjunction あいだ（に）

/// Complex sentences joined by the conjunction あいだ（に） may be used in the two situations described above, where the construction with ながら is not possible.

/// The conjunction あいだ may be written in kanji as 間, or in hiragana; both are acceptable.

<br>

/// The construction with あいだ（に） may be used for the actions of a single person or those of two different people.

/// It may also be used to express simultaneous continuous actions, state events, or punctual actions.

/// The use of に is not optional. See the next section for the meaning differences between the sentences with and without に.

<br>

/// In the first example below, that the complex sentence joined by あいだ（に） is used to express events happening with two different people simultaneously.

/// The second example shows that the predicate within the adverbial clause may be stative.

/// It would not be possible to use ながら in either of these cases.

<br>

子供が寝ているあいだ（に）、私は勉強しました。//I studied during the time that my child was sleeping.

私は日本にいるあいだ（に）、漢字をたくさん勉強しました。//I studied a lot of kanji during the time I was in Japan.

<br>

#### The use of に after 間 {あいだ}

/// The particle に in あいだに is not optional.

/// When the particle に is used immediately after 間, it indicates that the duration of the events in the two clauses is not the same.

<br>

子供が寝ている間に、私は勉強しました。//I studied for part of the time that my child was sleeping.

<br>

/// When no に is used, it indicates that the duration of the events in the two clauses is the same.

<br>

子供が寝ている間、私は勉強しました。//I studied while my child was sleeping.

<br>

/// When the action within the main clause is punctual (non-continuous), に is obligatory.

<br>

私は日本にいる間に、彼に会いました。//I met him while I was in Japan.

<br>

#### Predicate forms in the あいだ-clause

/// Because predicate forms in the あいだ-clause are normally durational, the aspect of the adverbial clause does not have to be in the perfective form even for the past events.

<br>

私が病気の間、あの人は手伝ってくださいました。//That person helped me during the time I was sick.

部屋が静かな間に、勉強しました。//I studied while the room was quiet.

子供が寝ているあいだに、勉強しました。//I studied while my child was asleep.

<br>

すみません。このバス、どこ行きですか。//Excuse me. Where does this bus go?

大阪行きです。//To Osaka.

京都行きはどこから出てますか。//Where does the bus to Kyoto leave from?

<br>

#### どこ行き

/// The stem of 行く is used to specify destination in a rather unusual structure.

/// When asking about a destination, it is used within the predicate in a complex noun, どこ行き, with no intervening particle.

/// The stem 行き may be pronounced either いき or ゆき; ゆき is very common in this context.

<br>

### (2) Expressing regret

<br>

ああ、どうしよう？やっぱり、試験、全然、だめだった！//What am I going to do? I knew this would happen . . . I totally messed up my exam!

僕も、あの試験、難しかったと思うよ。//I thought the exam was hard, too.

でも、昨日、私、音楽、聞きながら勉強してたから、私がいけないんだと思う。//But, it’s my fault . . . I listened to music the whole time I was studying yesterday.

<br>

#### どうしよう？

/// This is a casual version of どうしましょうか, “What should I do?” It is important to remember that ど う, rather than なん, is used for this expression.

<br>

#### やっぱり

/// This adverb is used when the speaker wants to express that the situation is what he or she has expected.

/// やっぱり is more casual than やはり.

<br>

#### 私がいけないんです

/// 私がいけない is an idiomatic expression that means “I am the one who should be blamed.”

/// ~んで す expresses that the speaker is trying to convince the addressee that it is his or her fault.

大丈夫ですよ。僕の車で駅まで行きましょう。//It’ll be fine. Let’s go to the station in my car.

ええ？いいんですか。ありがとうございます。本当に助かります。//Really? Are you sure? Thank you so much. What a great help!

<br>

/// 間に合わない is the negative form of the idiomatic phrase, 間に合う {まにあう} “to be on time.”

<br>

#### いいんですか

/// This expression is equivalent to an expression in English, “Are you sure that’s all right?” ~んです か indicates that the speaker wants to confirm his or her assumption or understanding.

<br>

#### 本当に助かります

/// 助かる {たすかる} is an intransitive verb indicating that “something is helpful to the situation that the person is in at the moment.”

/// When someone volunteers to help, this is an appropriate expression to use together with ありがとうございます in two separate sentences.stage ２，６。

# Stage 2-6 Complex Words

<br>

## 1: Complex Adjectives

### (1) What are complex words?

/// Words formed by combining other words are called complex words.

/// A complex word consists of the stem of a predicate joined by another word such as a verb, an adjective, an adverb, or a noun.

<br>

/// Classification of a complex word is based on its final component.

/// For instance, a complex word is an adjective if it consists of the stem of a predicate and an adjective, and a noun if it is formed by the stem of a predicate and a noun.

<br>

/// In this chapter, a variety of complex words will be introduced, including complex adjectives, complex verbs, complex nouns, and complex adjectival nouns.

<br>

### (2) [Stem + やすい(易い)]

/// The stem of a predicate and the adjective やすい together

/// express that the speaker can easily perform the act named by the verb.

<br>

/// The topic of this construction is the thing or the person the speaker describes.

<br>

この漢字は書きやすいですが、その漢字はあまり書きやすくありません。//This kanji is easy to write, but that one is not so easy to write.

この人の書いた手紙は読みやすかったです。//This person’s letters were easy to read.

この新しい外国のペンは書きやすくありませんでした。//The new, foreign pen wasn’t easy to write with.

<br>

/// The following example illustrates how a complex adjective modifies a noun:

<br>

この書きやすいペンはだれのですか。//Who owns this pen that’s so easy to write with?

<br>

/// Non-active verbs are not used in this construction

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) [Stem + にくい(難い)]

/// This construction indicates that the topic poses some kind of difficulty for the speaker.

<br>

この本は分かりにくいです。//This book is hard to understand.

あの先生には本当に話しにくかったです。//That teacher was very difficult to talk to.

<br>

/// The following is an example of using this complex adjective before a noun:

<br>

この分かりにくい本は父が書いた物です。//This hard-to-understand book was written by my father.

## 2: Complex Verbs

### (1) [Stem + 過ぎる {すぎる}]

/// This construction is used when the action denoted by the first element is performed in excess.

/// It is also used in excessive or hyperbolic descriptions.

<br>

#### With verbs

<br>

昨日、食べ過ぎました。//I ate too much yesterday.

パーティーで飲みすぎないでください。//Please don’t drink too much at the party.

<br>

#### With adjectives

/// The stems of adjectives are formed by dropping the final い. Use the stem of an adjective and add 過ぎる {すぎる}.

<br>

今日は、私には、寒過ぎます。//It’s too cold for me today.

あの人は頭がよすぎると皆に言われています。//Everyone says that he’s too smart.

<br>

#### With adjectival nouns

/// Adjectival nouns do not have stems since they do not conjugate.

/// In this construction, they come immediately before 過ぎる.

<br>

この部屋は静か過ぎます。//This room is too quiet.

<br>

#### With nouns

/// Some nouns may also be used in this construction, if the noun can imply certain degrees.

<br>

あの学生は子供過ぎます。//That student is too childish.

あの学生は金持ち過ぎて、貧乏な人の気持ちは分からないでしょうね。//That student has too much money, so he probably doesn’t understand how poor people feel.

<br>

#### With negative predicates

/// Although rare, it is possible to use the negative predicate in this construction.

/// All negative predicates contain ない, which follows the same conjugational pattern as adjectives.

/// In this construction, ない with 過ぎる produces なさ過ぎる with さ intervening between the syllable な and すぎる. (This kind of insertion happens when there are too few syllables between two separate elements.)

<br>

うちの子は元気がなさ過ぎます。//Our child is too unwell these days.

ここには頭のいい人がいなさ過ぎます。//There are too few smart people here.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Stem with other verbs

#### 始める -> [Stem + 始める]

/// -> "indicates the beginning of an event"

/// 始める {はじめる} is a transitive verb and meaning “to begin something.”

/// The complex verb formed from this verb indicates the beginning of an event:

<br>

晩ご飯を作り始めましょうか。//Shall we begin making supper?

宿題をし始めました。//I have begun doing my homework.

<br>

#### 出す {だす} -> [Stem + 出す]

/// -> "denotes the beginning of a continuous action or event"

/// Although 出す “to take something out” itself is transitive, it can be combined with both intransitive and transitive verbs.

<br>

/// The verb 思い出す {おもいだす} “to recall”; this verb in fact consists of the stem of the verb 思う {おもう} and the verb 出す {だす}.

/// This complex verb literally means something like “to take out what has been memorized.”

<br>

ああ、あの人の名前を思い出しました。//Oh, now I remember that person’s name.

<br>

/// This expression has an inceptive or inchoative sense, that is, it denotes the beginning of a continuous action or event.

<br>

雨が降り出しました。//It started to rain.

<br>

/// Complex verbs with 出す are very similar to those with 始める {はじめる}.

/// Compare the following two sentences:

<br>

あの人はゆっくり話し出しました。//The person slowly began speaking.

あの人はゆっくり話し始めました。//The person slowly began speaking.

<br>

/// When the speaker anticipates the beginning of an event, 始める may be used; while an unanticipated event may be expressed with 出す.

/// Thus, the first sentence above means that the person began talking and the speaker had not expected it;

/// the second sentence implies that the speech of the person, which the speaker had anticipated, began.

<br>

/// A similar nuance informs the difference in meaning between the following two sentences:

<br>

あの子供は泣き出しました。//The child began to cry.

あの子供は泣き始めました。//The child began to cry.

<br>

/// The first sentence indicates that the child began to cry when no one was expecting it to.

/// But the second sentence makes it sound as if people had been waiting for the child to cry, which could happen, for example, in a dramatic play.

<br>

#### 直す -> [Stem + 直す]

/// -> "an action is repeated"

/// 直す {なおす} by itself means “to correct” or “to repair.” 

<br>

コンピュータを直しました。//I fixed the computer.

<br>

/// When combined with the stem of another verb, the combined meaning implies that an action is repeated.

<br>

この本を読み直しました。//I re-read this book.

手紙を書き直しました。//I re-wrote the letter.

<br>

#### 忘れる -> [Stem + 忘れる]

/// -> "to express forgetting to do something"

/// 忘れる {わすれる} by itself means “to forget.”

<br>

かさを学校に忘れました。//I forgot my umbrella at school.

<br>

/// There are two ways to express forgetting to do something:

/// 1. use the stem of a verb and 忘れる;

/// 2. nominalize the verb with の in the object position (the use of こと rather than の is acceptable, but の is preferable).

<br>

母に電話し忘れました。//I forgot to call my mother.

母に電話するのを忘れました。//I forgot to call my mother.

<br>

/// Although there is only a small difference between the two sentences above, in certain cases the two structures are not interchangeable.

<br>

/// When the action indicated is from one point to a goal (e.g. going, returning, etc.), the use of complex verbs with 忘れる is awkward.

/// In this case, use the nominalized verb with の.

<br>

図書館に行くのを忘れました。//I forgot to go to the library.

今日、歩くのを忘れた。//I forgot to go for a walk today.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Complex Nouns with 方

/// -> [Stem + 方] -> “a way of (doing something).”

/// 方 {かた} means “method” or “way”;

/// thus, the coupling of a verb stem with this noun means “a way of (doing something).”

/// An equivalent expression in English is “how to do something.”

<br>

/// 読み方 “the way of reading” (how to read)

/// 書き方 “the way of writing” (how to write)

/// 食べ方 “the way of eating” (how to eat)

<br>

/// The combined words form a complex noun, so it is important to pay attention to the use of the particle の between the modifying noun and the modified noun.

<br>

今日は、手紙の書き方を習いました。//I learned how to write letters today.

すみませんが、この漢字の読み方を教えて下さいませんか。//Excuse me, but could you tell me how to read this kanji?

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Complex Adjectival Nouns with そう

/// Attaching そう to the stem of a predicate creates an adjectival noun that expresses the speaker’s inference based on his or her direct and immediate observation.

<br>

### (1) With adjectives and adjectival nouns

<br>

あの店のお茶はおいしそうです。//The tea at that shop looks delicious.

ここは静かそうです。//This place feels/looks quiet.

<br>

/// For the adjective いい and the negative ~ない, さ must be inserted between the first syllable and そう.

<br>

この本はよさそうです。//This book looks good

このケーキはおいしくなさそうです。//This cake doesn’t look very tasty.

<br>

### (2) With nouns

/// A noun cannot precede そう, but there is an equivalent word, みたい.

<br>

あの人は日本人みたいです。//That person looks Japanese.

<br>

### (3) As a modifier

/// Because complex words with みたい and そう are adjectival nouns, they must be followed by な when they modify a noun.

<br>

これはおいしそうなケーキですね。//This is a delicious-looking cake, isn’t it?

あの日本人みたいな人はだれですか。//Who is that Japanese-looking person?

<br>

### (4) With Verbs

/// The stem of a verb joined to the suffix ~そう also indicates the immediacy of an observed event.

/// This means that the speaker believes that something will occur very soon, based upon what he or she has observed.

<br>

雨が降りそうです。//It looks like it’s going to rain at any second.

今日は晴れそうですね。//It looks like it’s going to clear up today.

<br>

### (5) Complex words with more than two elements

/// Complex words may consist of more than two elements.

<br>

雨が降り出しそうです。//It looks like it’s going to start raining at any second.

この本は読みやすそうですね。//This book looks like it’s easy to read.

この食べにくそうな食べ物は何ですか。//What is this food that looks like it’s hard to eat?

<br>

#### ~そう and ようだ

/// As explained in earlier chapters, ようだ is used at the end of a sentence to express the speaker’s inference based on his or her observation.

/// The difference between the two is that an expression with ようだ lacks the immediacy of an expression including the stem with ~そう.

<br>

雨が降りそうですね。//It looks like it’s going to rain at any second.

雨が降るようですね。//It looks like it may rain.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Stems Used for Different Speech Levels

/// the honorific system in Japanese is quite complex.

/// the use of honorifics reflects the relation between the topic of a sentence and the speaker,

/// while the use of politeness depends on the relationship between the speaker and the addressee.

<br>

/// Here, a few more facts and the situations of the honorific system will be explained.

<br>

### (1) Inviting and giving instructions

<br>

#### Polite commands and requests

/// -> [~てください and ~てくださいませんか]

<br>

これを日本語で言って下さい。//Please say this in Japanese.

すみませんが、こちらに立たないで下さいませんか。//I’m sorry, but could you please not stand here?

<br>

#### Inviting someone to do something

/// -> [お + Stem + ください]

/// as when inviting a guest to enter the house or to sit somewhere

/// どうぞ is often added to further urge or invite someone to do something.

<br>

どうぞ、お入りください。//Please come (or go) in.

こちらにお座りください。//Please sit here.

<br>

お上がり下さい。//Please come in.

<br>

/// There is no real negative counterpart to the structure above, probably because invitations are generally not given in the negative form.

/// There are many expressions of prohibition, however.

/// Depending on the situation, it is possible to use the negative command or request in certain cases:

<br>

入らないで下さい（ませんか）。//Please do not enter.

<br>

#### Giving instructions to children or students

/// -> [Stem + なさい]

/// Parents or school teachers may use the structure to give instructions or (at times) orders to small children:

<br>

野菜をいっぱい食べなさい。//Eat lots of vegetables.

<br>

/// This structure is also used in examination instructions, in which case the recipients are not only small children.

<br>

次の言葉を漢字で書きなさい。//Write the following words in kanji.

<br>

/// Here, too, there is no exact negative counterpart, but some examples are given below (sentence-final particles used in conversation, such as ね and よ, are used in the following example sentences because they are conversational):

<br>

ここを走らないでね。//Don’t run here.

<br>

/// Alternatively, in spoken Japanese, the following structure with ~てはだめ or ~てはいけません in the predicate may be used:

<br>

ここを走っては、だめですよ。//running here is no good

ここを走っては、いけませんよ。//it won’t do to run here

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Honorific forms

/// For honorific verbs, there are at least three ways (actually, there are more) for the speaker to show his or her respect for the topic of the sentence.

<br>

#### Irregular honorific verbs

/// There are a handful of irregular honorific verbs.

/// The irregular honorific verbs いらっしゃる（いらっしゃ います）, おっしゃる（おっしゃいます）, and くださる（くださいます） have already been introduced.

<br>

ウィリアムズ先生は次の試験は長くないとおっしゃいました。//Williams-sensei said that the next test would not be long.

<br>

#### Formulaic honorific verbs

/// -> [お + Stem + に + なる]

/// Not all verbs have separate honorific verbs. Most honorific verbs are derived from the construction:

<br>

先生はこの本をお読みになりました。//The teacher read this book.

森先生がこの本をお書きになりました。//Mori-sensei is the one who wrote this book.

<br>

#### Passive forms

/// may also be used to express respect, though they are less honorific than the two constructions above.

<br>

先生も明日、行かれますか。//Will you also go tomorrow, Sensei?

先輩はこれをもう読まれましたか。//Have you already read this, Senpai?

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Humble forms

/// Humble verbs, which are a part of the honorific system in Japanese,

/// are used to refer to the speaker’s (or his/her うち-group’s) own action in the presence of someone the speaker respects.

/// Just like honorific verbs, there are irregular and regular humble forms.

<br>

#### Irregular humble verbs

/// There are a handful of humble verbs that are irregular insofar as they are not derived from the base forms of corresponding verbs.

<br>

/// 申す {もうす} is the humble version of the neutral verb 言う {いう};

<br>

私はリンと申します。//I’m Lin.

私はリンと言います。//I’m Lin.

<br>

/// 参る {まいる} is the humble version of the directional verbs 行く {いく} and 来る {くる}.

<br>

私は明日、こちらに参りません。//I won’t come here tomorrow.

私は明日、そちらに参りません。//I won’t go there tomorrow.

<br>

/// Formulaic humble verbs

/// -> [お + Stem + する]

/// Most verbs do not have separate humble verbs. For those verbs, use the construction:

<br>

/// Irregular and formulaic humble verbs are different with respect to when the speaker should use them.

/// Formulaic humble verbs are used only when the speaker does or did something for the person for whom he or she expresses his or her respect.

/// If the action is not done for that person, a formulaic humble verb should not be used.

/// Irregular humble forms do not have this restriction; that is, they may be used for the speaker’s action that is not performed for other people.

<br>

私がお書きします。//I will write it for you.

お読みしましょうか。//Shall I read it for you?

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) Welcoming a visitor

<br>

ごめんください。//Hello!

はあい。ああ、林さん、いらっしゃい（ませ）。どうぞ、お上がりください。//Yes? Oh, Hayashi-san, welcome. Please do come in.

お邪魔します。//Thank you.

<br>

/// ごめんください can be used to announce one’s arrival when visiting people at their home.

/// It is used at the entrance, when the speaker is afraid the host has not noticed that he or she is there.

/// can also be used as a closing phrase when talking on the phone.

<br>

#### いらっしゃい（ませ）

/// The host normally welcomes the guest with this greeting. 

/// ませ makes this expression more polite.

<br>

#### お上がりください

/// the verb 上がる {あがる} literally means “to rise.”

<br>



#### お邪魔します

/// 邪魔 {じゃま} is an adjectival noun that means “interference.”

/// お邪魔します is used often when going into someone else’s house, room, or office.

<br>



### (2) I wonder…

<br>

あの人、だれ？//Who’s that?

井上さんじゃない？//Isn’t that Inoue-san?

井上さん、何だか、話しにくい人じゃない？//Don’t you think she’s kind of hard to talk to?

ううん・・・そうかな？でも、あの人、とってもかわいそうな人・・・//Huh . . . I guess that’s true, isn’t it? But, you know, I feel really sorry for her.

へえ？そうなの？//Is that right?

<br>

/// 何だか {なんだか}, which means “for some reason,” is used in conversation to express that the reason for a certain thing is not very clear to the speaker.

<br>

#### Rhetorical question with かな

/// かな is used in conversation, when the speaker expresses a question about something without addressing it to anyone but him or herself;

/// the nuance is something like, “I wonder if (such-and-such).”

<br>

/// かわいそう should be regarded as a single word rather than a complex word.

/// The speaker can use this adjectival noun when he or she feels sorry for someone, no matter the reason.

<br>

### (3) For example

<br>

あなたが嫌いな人って、どんな人？//What kind of people get on your nerves?

そうねえ。例えば、話しすぎる人とか、いつも文句を言う人・・・。//Um, let’s see. For example, people who talk too much, or people who complain all the time.

<br>

/// The noun 文句 {もんく} means “complaint.”

/// The associated verb is 言う {いう}, “to say.”

/// The phrase 文句を言う {もんくをいう} therefore means “to complain.”stage ２，７。

# Stage 2-7 Complex Predicates

## 1: Complex Predicates with つもりだ and はずだ

<br>

### (1) What is a complex predicate and what does it do?

/// A complex predicate is a predicate consisting of two or more elements.

/// In Japanese, different elements are added onto the basic predicate to convey the speaker’s view or interpretation of a situation, or his or her intention, among many other things.

<br>

### (2) つもりだ

/// the functional noun つもり and the copula です can be added to a predicate to indicate the speaker’s plan.

<br>

私は来年、日本で勉強するつもりです。//I plan to study in Japan next year.

<br>

/// The negative imperfective form is used in the adjectival clause if the speaker plans not to do something.

<br>

来年、日本で勉強しないつもりです。//My plan is not to study in Japan next year.

<br>

/// It is possible to negate the copula, instead of the verb preceding つもりだ, but this changes the meaning slightly.

/// By negating the copula, the speaker corrects the other person’s positive assumption.

<br>

来年、日本で勉強するつもりじゃありません。//Actually, I don’t plan to go to Japan to study next year.

<br>

#### Restriction on the use of the construction

/// The construction with つもりだ has the same restriction on its use as other emotive expressions; that is,

/// the topic of this construction is the speaker, or the addressee if a question is asked directly.

/// This construction therefore is not used to discuss a third person’s plan or intention.

<br>

カーターさんは、来年、どこで勉強するつもりですか。//Where do you plan to study next year, Carter-san?

私はイギリスで勉強するつもりです。//I plan to study in England.

<br>

/// A third person’s intent may be expressed by reporting what he or she has said, by expressing the speaker’s belief with the verb 思う {おもう}, or by using other complex predicates.

<br>

リンさんは来年、日本で勉強するつもりだと言っていました。//Lin-san said that he plans to study in Japan next year.

ウィリアムズさんは来年、日本で勉強するつもりだと思います。//I believe Williams-san is planning to study in Japan next year.

<br>

### (3) はずだ

/// A complex predicate with はずだ expresses the speaker’s expectation of a certain event;

/// the event need not relate directly to the speaker.

/// Although つもりだ is not used to discuss a third person’s intent, this may be expressed with はずだ.

/// This construction indicates that the speaker is expressing his or her understanding of the third person’s intent.

<br>

カーターさんは来年、日本で勉強するはずです。//It is my understanding that Carter-san will study in Japan next year.

私は来年、日本に行けるはずです。//I believe that I’ll be able to go to Japan next year.

<br>

#### The difference between はず and 思う {おもう}

/// In many sentences, はずだ and 思う can be interchanged, but they each convey a different nuance.

/// 思う expresses the speaker’s personal opinion,

/// but はずだ an objective expectation the speaker infers from some source.

<br>

もうすぐ、先生はいらっしゃるはずです。//I expect the teacher to be here very soon.

もうすぐ、先生はいらっしゃると思います。//I think the teacher will be here soon.

<br>

/// The next pair of sentences illustrate that はずだ expresses the speaker’s belief regarding a certain fact or event, but it may not be used to express a specific personal opinion arising from direct experience.

/// In the latter case, 思う would be used.

<br>

日本語を勉強しているんですか。//Is it true that you’re studying Japanese?

ええ、日本語は難しいですが、本当におもしろい言葉だと思います。//Yes. Japanese is difficult, but I think it’s a very interesting language.

<br>

/// Since the second sentence expresses the speaker’s opinion, はずだ cannot be substituted for 思う

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Complex Predicates with のだ

/// The underlying notion of the use of の (or ん in more casual conversation) and the copula だ in complex predicates gives the sense that the statement or question includes the speaker’s personal interpretation.

/// However, it is easier to learn the meanings this structure can convey when used in statements and questions separately.

<br>

### (1) In questions

/// When の（ん）だ is used with a yes-no question sentence,

/// it indicates that the speaker would like to confirm his or her understanding of a certain situation with the addressee.

<br>

#### Situation 1

<br>

天ぷらが好きなんですか。//I guess you like tempura, don’t you?

<br>

/// Note that な must be used between a nominal element and の（ん）だ.

<br>

#### Situation 2

/// When の（ん）だ is used with an information-seeking question, it indicates that the speaker would like to receive some kind of explanation.

<br>

どこへ行くんですか。//Would you tell me where you’re going?

/// [The speaker seeks an explanation.]

<br>

/// The following question is a straightforward question in which the speaker wants to know where the addressee will go (there is no implication of asking why):

<br>

どこに行きますか。//Where are you going?

<br>

#### Situation 3

/// When the speaker suspects that something unusual has happened to the addressee, he or she can confirm this observation and at the same time convey that he or she would like some kind of explanation from the addressee.

/// The following questions are a few of those that could be used in such a situation:

<br>

何があったんですか。//Tell me, what happened?

何かあったんですか。//Did something happen? – Tell me.

どうしたんですか。//Tell me what happened. Is something wrong?

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) In statements

/// When の（ん）だ is added to the predicate of a statement, it adds the sense that the speaker is giving an explanation of a past or future action.

<br>

/// In the following sentence, the first clause with のだ gives an explanation why the speaker mentions in the main clause that he or she has no money.

<br>

来年、日本に行きたいと思っているのですが、お金がありません。//You may know that I’d like to go to Japan next year, but I don’t have any money.

<br>

/// When asking a professor a question, for example, it is a good idea to explain the reason for asking the question.

/// It is therefore appropriate to use this complex predicate in the first clause:

<br>

来年、日本に行きたいのですが、どの学校がいいでしょうか。//I’d like to go to Japan next year. What school do you think is good?

<br>

/// This complex predicate may also be used both in a why-question and its response in conversation.

<br>

どうして、授業を休んだんですか。//Tell me why you were absent from the class.

頭が痛かったんです。//It was because I had a headache.

<br>

/// the use of ん instead of の is strictly for casual speech.

/// It is therefore not advisable to write ん or use it on more formal occasions.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Complex Predicates with そうだ

/// The complex predicate with そうだ simply conveys information that the speaker has gathered from an outside source (such as TV, radio, newspaper, friends, etc.).

/// The sentence with そうだ is therefore used to objectively report information that the speaker has gathered.

<br>

/// The following example sentences include a verbal, an adjectival, and a nominal (both with an adjectival noun and a noun) predicate before そうだ.

<br>

午後、雨が降るそうです。//My source tells me that it will rain this afternoon.

あの店のお茶はおいしいそうです。//I’ve learned that tea at that shop is delicious.

/// learned or heard/read/

<br>

/// The copula だ needs to be used between a noun or an adjectival noun and そう.

<br>

ここは静かだそうです。//I’ve learned that this place is quiet.

/// learned or heard/read/

あの人は日本人だそうです。//I’ve learned that that person is Japanese.

/// learned or heard/read/

<br>

### (1) Information source

/// The objective source of information in sentences with そうだ may be marked by によると.

<br>

テレビによると、今日は雨が降るそうです。//According to the TV, it’s going to rain today.

林さんの話によると、去年、東京は雪が降ったそうです。//According to Hayashi-san, it snowed in Tokyo last year.

<br>

### (2) Complex predicates with そうだ and quotative sentences with 聞く {きく}

/// These constructions are different in that the means by which the information is conveyed is clearer in the construction with 聞いた {きいた}.

/// The construction with そうだ does not clarify whether the information was “read,” “heard,” or received in some other way, unless he source is identified.

<br>

/// Another difference between these constructions is that the topic of the predicate 聞く is the person who hears the content;

/// however, the topic of the predicate そうだ is not the person who has the information, but the thing or the person that the predicate describes.

<br>

/// In addition, the complex predicate そうだ cannot express the specific time at which the information was obtained, but with the predicate 聞く this is possible.

<br>

午後、雨が降ると聞きました。//I heard that it would rain in the afternoon.

あの人は日本人だと聞きました。//I heard that that person is Japanese.

<br>

家に帰った時に、弟が日本に留学をすると聞いた。//When I went home, I heard that my brother was going to study abroad in Japan.

<br>

### (3) Two different そう

/// Be aware that the complex adjectival noun with そう and the complex predicate with そう（だ） have almost opposite meanings in terms of the information source.

<br>

/// Compare the following two sentences below:

<br>

このケーキはおいしそうですね。//This cake looks delicious!

このケーキはおいしいそうですね。//I hear that this cake is delicious.

<br>

/// The first sentence is uttered based on the speaker’s direct and immediate observation,

/// while the second sentence is based on an outside source, such as hearing from someone else, reading, or some other means.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Conjunctive Forms and Other Verbs

/// There are predicates that consist of two verbs, the first of which is in the conjunctive form.

/// This kind of predicate is quite different from a complex predicate, the biggest distinction being that the speaker’s views are not relevant in these predicates.

<br>

/// Although it is not always the case, the second verb is generally not written in kanji in these predicates.

<br>

### (1) ~てくる (て来る) and ~ていく (て行く)

<br>

#### The verb くる to indicate returning

/// When くる is used after another verb, it indicates that the speaker will return as soon as the event expressed by the first verb is complete.

<br>

コーヒーを買います。//I’ll buy some coffee.

コーヒーを買ってきます。//I’ll go and get some coffee.

<br>

/// The first sentence literally means that the speaker will buy coffee and come back to where he or she was.

/// The second sentence indicates only that the speaker will purchase coffee (no mention is made of coming back):

<br>

走ってきました。//I went running, but I’m back now.

<br>

/// The above sentence indicates that the speaker has returned from running.

<br>

何をしたんですか。//Tell me what you did.

コーヒーを買ったんです。//I bought coffee.

<br>

どこに行ったんですか。//Tell me where you’ve been.

コーヒーを買ってきたんです。//I just went out to get coffee.

<br>

#### Verbs くる and いく to indicate the beginning of an event

/// くる and いく indicate the direction of movement.

/// Since くる describes the topic approaching the speaker, it sometimes expresses the beginning of an event.

<br>

雨が降ってきました。//It’s started raining.

晴れてきました。//It’s beginning to clear up.

曇ってきました。//It’s starting to cloud over.

<br>

/// In the first sentence above, くる conveys the nuance that the rain is coming down on or towards the speaker. いく may not be used here.

/// The second and third sentences convey the nuance that the speaker has directly perceived the changes in the weather.

<br>

/// the combination of the verbs 出る {でる} and いく gives the sense that the topic is moving away from the speaker.

<br>

ルームメートが明日ここから出ていきます。//My roommate is moving away tomorrow.

<br>

#### Metaphorical meanings

/// In addition to their specific meanings,

/// the directional verbs くる and いく can also be used to describe something moving metaphorically towards or away from the speaker.

<br>

/// For instance, if the speaker had trouble understanding something earlier and has finally begun to understand it after much thought, he or she can use this statement:

<br>

分かってきました。//I’m beginning to understand.

<br>

/// The くる in the above sentence indicates that understanding has moved, metaphorically, towards the speaker’s mind.

<br>

日本語を忘れていきます。//I’m starting to forget Japanese.

<br>

/// In the example above, いく indicates that the knowledge the speaker once had is moving away from him or her, metaphorically speaking.

/// くる would not be used in this case.

<br>

### (2) ~ておく

/// The verb 置く {おく}, which means “to place something somewhere,” is used as a regular verb, as in the following example:

<br>

私は鞄を机の上に置きました。//I put my backpack on the desk.

<br>

/// When this verb is combined in a predicate with another verb, it implies that the action will result in a benefit at a later time.

<br>

### (3) Non-fixed use of the ても-adverbials

/// The ても-adverbials may also be used in a non-fixed way.

/// The ても-adverbial expresses a condition that would have been sufficient for the (desirable) expected outcome, but the actual consequence expressed in the main clause indicates that the expected (desired) outcome did not occur.

/// Because of this, the main clause is often in the negative.

<br>

/// the sentence indicates an undesirable outcome despite repeated efforts.

/// Such phrases can be used in a non-fixed way.

<br>

あの人に言われたら、どこにでも行きます。//I’ll go anywhere that person tells me to.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: ては-Adverbials

/// Adverbial clauses with ~ては also have both fixed and non-fixed expressions.

<br>

### (1) Expressing prohibition with ~てはいけない or ~てはだめ

/// Both of these fixed expressions indicate that the topicalized element is not acceptable.

/// だめ has a more colloquial tone than いけない.

お客さんに出すお茶は古くてはだめです。//You mustn’t serve old tea to guests.

学生に出す宿題は簡単な宿題ではいけません。//The homework you give to students shouldn’t be easy.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (2) Non-fixed ては-adverbials

<br>

そんなことを言っては、失礼です。//It’s rude to say such a thing.

そんなことを言うのは、失礼です。//Saying such a thing would be rude.

<br>

/// The difference between the two is that the first sentence with ~ては implies that the act of saying has taken place, while the second sentence does not.

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Expressing obligation with ~なくては

/// Obligation may be expressed by the following fixed structures: ~なくてはならない, ~なくてはいけない, and ~なくてはだめ.

/// The basic meaning of these phrases comes from the literal meaning, “if (something) did not happen, it would not do.”

/// From this meaning, the nuance of obligation comes through, as in “One must/should do/be such-and-such.”

<br>

/// The difference among the three options is that of formality:

/// the most formal is ~なくてはならない; then ~なくてはいけない; and ~なくてはだめ is colloquial.

/// The following example uses a verbal predicate:

<br>

すぐに行かなくてはだめです。//I’d better go soon.

/// or いけません・なりません

靴は日本製じゃなくてはいけません。//Shoes should be Japan-made.

/// or なりません・だめです

この部屋の机は新しくなくてはなりません。//The desk in this room should be new.

/// or いけません・だめです

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Expressing obligation with ~なければ

/// Obligation may also be expressed by changing the above fixed structure with ~なくては to one with ~なければ and adding the same three options: ~なければはならない, ~なければいけない, and ~なければだめ.

/// The basic meaning of these phrases shares the similar literal meaning as ~なくては: that is, “if (something) did not happen, it would not do.”

/// This meaning is also communicates a sense of obligation, as in “One must/should do/be such-and-such.”

<br>

/// The difference among the three options is, again, formality:

/// the most formal is ~なければならない; then ~なければいけない; and ~なければだめ is colloquial.

<br>

/// For the sake of comparison, the following examples are identical to the ones above except for ~な ければ instead of ~なくては.

/// The examples below use all three predicates (verbal, nominal, and adjectival, in order):

<br>

すぐに行かなければだめです。//I’d better go soon.

/// or いけません・なりません

靴は日本製じゃなければいけません。//Shoes should be Japan-made.

/// or なりません・だめです

この部屋の机は新しくなければなりません。//The desk in this room should be new.

/// or いけません・だめです

<br>

#### The difference between the two expressions of obligation

/// The difference between the two is small.

/// An obligation expressed with ~なければ sounds a little stronger and more formal than one expressed with ~なくては.

<br>

#### Conditionals with ば

/// The fixed expression with ~なければ comes from the conditional predicate form, the ば-form, which will be introduced below.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Conditional Adverbial Clauses with ~ば

/// Thus far, it has been explained that time and situational conditions are expressed with adverbial clauses joined by the conjunctions 時 {とき}, 前 {まえ}, 後 {あと}, or と.

/// The predicate form ~たら may also be used in the adverbial clause in this case.

/// Another adverbial clause that expresses situational conditions is joined by the so-called ば-form of the predicate.

<br>

### (1) Creating the ば-formation

/// Nominal predicate       である → であれば

/// ex 日本人であれば

/// Adjectival predicate    い → ければ

/// ex たかければ, よければ

/// Verbal predicate        the last {u} to {e} and add ば

/// ex たべれば, はなせば, くれば

<br>

#### である as the copula

/// is a more formal copula than だ. 

<br>

姉は医者だ。姉は医者である。//My older sister is a medical doctor.

<br>

/// The ば-form of the copula, であれば, is based only on である and not with だ.

<br>

### (2) Using the ば-conditional

/// The ば-conditional is used only for an assumed situational condition, the realization of which the speaker is not so sure of.

/// That is, the condition stated in the ば-conditional may or may not be true.

<br>

夕食が和食であれば、私は行きません。//If Japanese food is on the menu for dinner, I’m not going.

<br>

/// A similar meaning can also be expressed with the たら-conditional.

/// The “uncertainty” of the condition in the ば-conditional is stronger than that in the たら-conditional, which causes the ば-conditional to sound a little more formal than the たら-conditional.

/// This phenomenon is somewhat universal.

/// In English, as well, it is generally more polite to use the subjunctive mood (see next section) than the indicative (statement) mood: for instance, “should you come this way” is more polite than “if you come this way.”

<br>

/// もし may be used with this type of sentence to emphasize the uncertainty of the condition.

/// もし has no one-word equivalent word in English, but it expresses a notion of something like “there may be a chance of a certain condition” or “if ever (this) should happen.”

<br>

もし、明日、彼が来なければ、大変なことになります。//If by any chance he did not come here tomorrow, it would be tragic.

<br>

### (3) The difference between ~たら and ~ば

/// another difference between the ~たら and the ~ば conditionals has to do with talking about an event that actually happened.

/// the たら-conditional can express an unexpected consequence when the predicate of the main clause is expressed in the perfective form.

/// The main clause is in the perfective form because the event actually did happen.

/// However, the ば-conditional may not be used to talk about an event that really occurred.

/// Since the ば-adverbial indicates only an assumed situation, the main clause is always in the imperfective form.

<br>

家に帰ったら、母が来ていました。//When I went home, I was surprised to find my mother there.

<br>

### (4) Subjunctive use

/// The subjunctive is a way to express a hypothetical situation.

/// For instance, in English, one might say, “If I were you, I wouldn’t have done that.”

/// Obviously, the speaker is not the addressee and never will be; the expression refers to an imaginary situation.

<br>

/// In Japanese, this subjunctive meaning is expressed by the たら-form more often than the ば-form.

/// This is because the syllable ~た of ~たら is the same as the perfective ~た, and an assumed completion of the situation is presented in the adverbial clause.

/// This sort of an assumed completion of the situation may not be expressed by the ば-conditional.

<br>

もし、私があなただったら、そんなことはしていなかっただろう。//If I were you, I wouldn’t have done such a thing.

<br>

### (5) Fixed expressions with the ば-forms

/// The ば-conditional form is used in a few fixed expressions, some of which are introduced below.

<br>

#### どうすれば

/// This construction is used to ask for advice about how best to achieve a certain thing.

<br>

どうすれば、漢字がもっと覚えられるでしょうか。//What’s the best way for me to memorize more kanji?

<br>

/// どうすれば often accompanies いい, as used in the following.

<br>

あの人に連絡できないのですが、どうすればいいと思いますか。//I can’t get in touch with him, so what do you think I should do?

<br>

#### ~ば…ほど

/// Repeating the same verb, once with the ば-conditional and another time with the imperfective form plus ほど, indicates the incremental degree of a description expressed in the independent clause.

<br>

この本は、読めば読むほど、面白くなってきますね。//The more I read this book, the more interesting it gets.

日本語は、勉強すればするほど、難しくなってきます。//The more we study Japanese, the more difficult it becomes.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Adverbial Phrases with として, としても, and としては

### (1) として

/// A noun followed by the particle と and して is a fixed phrase indicating that the noun marked by として is a publicly-recognized category that the topic belongs to.

<br>

加藤先生は日本語の先生として、この大学で教えています。//Kato-sensei teaches at this college as a professor of Japanese.

田中先生は日本語の先生として有名です。//Tanaka-sensei is famous as a Japanese teacher.

<br>

### (2) としても vs. としては

/// として introduced above is also used with は and も, each of which expresses a different nuance.

<br>

/// としては indicates that the attribute of the noun is less than what the speaker expected, while a noun marked with としても is more than expected:

<br>

#### Situation 1

/// Suppose that Williams-san is an American.

/// Americans are generally expected to be taller than Japanese.

/// If the speaker judges that William-san is shorter than a regular American is expected to be, he or she would mark the noun with としては:

<br>

ウィリアムズさんは、アメリカ人としては、背が低いですね。//Williams-san is short for an American.

<br>

#### Situation 2

/// Suppose that Williams-san is an American.

/// The speaker expects Americans to be tall, but Williamssan is even taller than other Americans.

/// In that case, the noun would be marked with としても:

<br>

ウィリアムズさんは、アメリカ人としても、背が高いですね。//Williams-san is tall even for an American.

<br>

/// So, when offering tea, you can say お茶でも、飲みますか, meaning “Would you like to drink tea or something of that sort?”

<br>

#### 今はちょっと

/// It means something like “Now is not such a good time.” 

<br>

#### 食べる気しない   {たべる き しない}

/// In this expression, が is deleted from 気しない, and the complete phrase should be 気がしない  {き がしない}.

<br>

/// だって is a casual expression that means something similar to でも.

<br>

#### 何でも食べなきゃ  {なん でも たべなきゃ}

# Stage 3-1 Objective vs. Personal Expressions

<br>

## 1: こと and の

### (1) Review of こと and の

/// The following is a summary of points that have already been introduced.

/// One new piece of information is added at the end of this section, namely the use of こと and の in the predicate position.

/// After this review section, additional information on こと and の will be introduced.

<br>

#### こと as a noun and の as a pronoun

/// The following examples show that こと is a noun, while の is a pronoun:

<br>

昨日、山田さんに面白いことを聞きました。//I heard an interesting thing from Yamada-san yesterday.

さっきまであなたのことについて話していました。//We were talking about you until a little while ago.

私が読んだ本はこの本です。あなたが読んだのはどれですか。//This book is the one that I read. Which one did you read?

<br>

#### こと and の as nominalizers

/// Both こと and の function grammatically as nominalizers, and they often can be used interchangeably in such positions as the topic and the object.

<br>

毎日、歩くことは体にとてもいいです。//Walking every day is very good for your health.

/// or 毎日、歩くのは体にとてもいいです。

<br>

僕は人の前で話すのが嫌いです。//I don’t like to speak in front of other people.

/// or 僕は人の前で話すことが嫌いです。

<br>

#### Non-interchangeable こと and の in fixed phrases

/// In many fixed phrases such as with ある and できる, こと and の are not interchangeable.

/// In the following cases, only こと may be used.

<br>

先生を家に招待したことはありませんが、先輩を招待したことが一度、あります。//I have never invited a teacher to my home, but I once invited a senior student.

私は漢字が二千も読むことができます。//I can read as many as two thousand kanji.

<br>

#### Non-interchangeable こと and の in predicates

/// Although the fact has not been introduced up to this point, こと and の are not interchangeable when used as nominalizers in the predicate.

/// In this case, only こと may be used.

<br>

私の趣味は本を読むことです。//My hobby is reading books.

<br>

### (2) The referent of の

/// In some cases, the referent of the pronoun の is not given anywhere in the sentence or discourse.

/// The referent of の, however, is quite apparent from the meaning of a sentence.

/// In the first example, の refers to a place, and in the second, の refers to a person.

<br>

私が生まれたのは東京です。//Tokyo is where I was born.

私が話したのは山田さんです。//The one I spoke to was Yamada-san.

<br>

### (3) こと and の with perception verbs

/// There is a significant difference between こと and の when they are used with verbs of perception.

<br>

私は中田さんがピアノをひいているのを聞きました。//I heard Nakada-san playing the piano.

私は中田さんがピアノをひいていることを聞きました。//I heard that Nakada-san is (or has been) playing the piano (somewhere).

<br>

/// The two sentences are identical except for the use of こと and の.

/// Yet the meaning of each is quite different.

/// In the first sentence, the speaker directly perceived Nakada-san playing the piano in person, so only の is acceptable here.

<br>

/// In the second sentence, in which こと is used, what the speaker heard was the information or report that Nakada-san is (or has been) playing the piano.

/// The speaker did not get a direct perception of Nakada-san’s playing by hearing it in person at all;

/// what she or he heard was the fact that Nakadasan is (or has been) playing the piano. Here only こと may be used.

<br>

上田さんが歩いているのを見ました。//I saw Ueda-san walking.

<br>

/// In this case, こと is unacceptable because the speaker is the one who saw Ueda-san walking.

/// It is not possible to see the information.

<br>

/// In sum, when the main verbs are perceptual verbs such as 聞く {きく} and 見る, こと and の are not interchangeable.

/// こと gives an indirect objective interpretation of an event while の gives a personal and direct one.

<br>

/// When こと and の are interchangeable, as in some of the earlier sentences above,

/// there is a nuance difference, objective vs. personal, between the two sentences.

<br>

### (4) の in complex predicates

/// の（ん in conversation） is used in the predicate to indicate that the statement made in the sentence is the speaker’s explanation.

/// の in the following two examples is the same の as in のだ.

<br>

#### のだろう

/// As explained earlier, だろう, instead of だ, is used when the speaker is not 100% certain that the statement is true.

<br>

この授業はそんなに難しくないでしょう。//This class is probably not that difficult.

<br>

/// When の intervenes between the first predicate and だろう,

/// it indicates that the speaker is giving his or her own interpretation based on first-hand observation.

/// Recall that な must stand between the nominal predicate and の.

<br>

あの女の人は先生なのだろう。//From what I have seen, I think that woman is probably a teacher.

<br>

/// Recall that the speaker is not able to express a third person’s emotion in the predicate directly.

/// When の is used in the predicate, it indicates that the statement is based on the speaker’s observation.

/// Since the use of だろう makes it less certain, the combination is quite appropriate to express a third person’s feelings.

<br>

あの人は犬がこわいのでしょう。//From my observations, it seems like that guy is afraid of dogs.

<br>

/// The following is an example of a verbal predicate.

/// The context of the following statement might be that the speaker has been wondering how Suzuki-san will reach his destination.

/// The speaker might make the following statement based on his or her own observations:

<br>

鈴木さんは自転車で行くのでしょう。//I gather that Suzuki-san will probably go by bicycle.

<br>

#### のかもしれない

/// かもしれない used at the end of a predicate conveys a meaning that is very similar to the structure with だろう discussed above.

/// However, だろう conveys more certainty than かもしれない.

<br>

/// As is the case with だろう, the use of の before かもしれない indicates that the statement is made based on the speaker’s direct observation,

/// and therefore expresses his or her own interpretation of the situation.

/// もしかすると means something like “by chance; there is a chance.” It is used often with かもし れない.

<br>

もしかすると、友達は来週、来るのかもしれません。//Based on my observation, I think there is a chance my friend will come next week.

もしかすると、あの人はこれが見えないのかもしれません。//Based on my observations, I think it’s possible that he is unable to see this.

<br>

## 2: Adverbial Clauses with ので and のに

### (1) Adverbial clauses with ので

/// ので comes from the complex predicate のだ. The で in ので is the conjunctive form of the copula だ.

/// As previously explained, のだ is used in statements to convey the speaker’s personal explanation.

<br>

/// To answer a why-question, it is quite possible to simply respond by using the complex predicate のだ.

<br>

どうして、昨日、授業を休んだのですか。//So, why didn’t you come to class yesterday?

ちょっとお腹が痛かったんです。//Because I had a stomachache.

<br>

/// Although ので is related to のだ, as explained above, it functions as a clausal conjunction to connect the cause-adverbial to its consequence.

<br>

お腹が痛かったので、昨日、授業を休みました。//I didn’t go to class yesterday because I had a stomachache.

<br>

/// So far, three structures that indicate a cause-consequence relation have been introduced.

/// Some differences among the three are discussed below.

<br>

### (2) Differences between から and ので

#### Structural differences between から and ので

/// The only structural difference between から and ので arises when the first clause is a nominal predicate.

/// The plain copula だ must be used before から, while な must be used before ので:

<br>

あの人は日本人だから、日本語を話します。//She speaks Japanese because she is Japanese.

あの人は日本人なので、日本語を話します。//She speaks Japanese because she is Japanese.

<br>

#### Differences in meaning between から and ので

/// ので and から are interchangeable most of the time, especially when the main clause states a factual event.

/// The general difference is that causes expressed with から provide objective reasons, while those with ので offer personal ones.

/// Therefore, even when either one is acceptable, this difference in nuance exists.

<br>

これはあまりおいしくないので、食べませんでした。//This didn’t taste very good, so I didn’t eat it.

これはあまりおいしくないから、食べませんでした。//This didn’t taste very good, so I didn’t eat it.

<br>

#### Cases in which ので should not be used

/// When the main clause expresses such things as requests, commands, suggestions, or invitations, the use of ので can be awkward.

/// Such clauses are better joined by から, which is used in more objective cause-consequence sequences.

<br>

これはあまりおいしくないから、食べないで下さい。//Please don’t eat this, because it doesn’t taste good.

<br>

/// Another situation in which the use of ので is inappropriate is when the copula is used as an abbreviated predicate.

<br>

この大学の学生はなぜ日本語を勉強しませんか。//Why don’t students at this college study Japanese?

日本語の先生がいないからです。//Because they don’t have a Japanese teacher.

<br>

/// ので may not be used in such an abbreviated way.

/// Because the で of ので is the conjunctive form of the copula, another copula may not be used consecutively.

<br>

/// Instead, のです may be used as a complex predicate.

<br>

日本語の先生がいないの（ん）です。//Because there isn’t a Japanese teacher there.

<br>

#### The politeness factor

/// In general, sentences in which ので is used are more polite than those with から.

/// This is because の で implies a sense of a personal accountability for the cause-consequence relation;

/// that is, the speaker takes responsibility for the cause of the consequence.

<br>

#### The cause with ~て

/// When the causal adverbial clause with ~て is used, the consequence expressed in the main clause must be a naturally occurring result, such as emotion or ability.

/// It may not be an intentional act.

<br>

これはおいしくなくて、食べられませんでした。//This didn’t taste very good, so I couldn’t eat it.

<br>

### (3) Adverbial clauses with のに

/// The meaning of the adverbial clause with のに is “despite the fact (given in the dependent clause).”

/// The の of this のに is the same の previously discussed in this chapter; that is, the personal interpretation.

/// The function of のに is quite similar to けれども in the sense that they are both used in adverbial clauses.

/// The similar conjunctions が and でも are not used in complex sentences.

<br>

/// The basic difference between のに and けれども is that のに may not be used when the main clause does not state a factual event.

<br>

/// The の in のに may not be reduced to ん, even for casual speech. (The の in ので, however, may be shortened to ん).

<br>

あの子供はもう随分大きいのに、まだ話せません。//Although that child seems rather big to me, he still can’t talk.

あの人は日本人なのに、着物をぜんぜん着ません。//Although I know that that person is Japanese, she never wears a kimono.

<br>

/// As the following incorrect example demonstrates, のに may not be used when the main clause is a command, request, or suggestion.

<br>

/// In this case, the two clauses may be joined by けれども. See the following:

<br>

寒いけれども、ここに来て下さいませんか。//Even though it’s cold, could you please come over here?

<br>

/// When the main clause expresses an outcome that has already taken place, the sentence is quite acceptable.

<br>

寒いのに、泳ぎに行きました。//Even though it was cold, we went swimming.

<br>

/// When the adverbial clause expresses a condition that is or was inconvenient to others,

/// and the main clause indicates that a task was completed despite this adverse condition,

/// it is better to use のに than the objective けれども.

/// のに indicates that the speaker is aware of the adverse condition.

<br>

北村さんは気分がよくないのに、私を手伝ってくれました。//I knew that Kitamura-san wasn’t feeling well, but she helped me anyway.

<br>

/// When thanking someone for doing something in spite of adverse conditions, this difference should be easy to understand.

<br>

お忙しいのに、来てくださって、本当にありがとうございました。//I know how busy you are, and I do appreciate your coming here despite that.

<br>

## 3: Situation-Focus vs. Person-Focus

### (1) Revisiting verbs する and なる

/// Situation-focused vs. person-focused expressions were introduced with using the verbs する and なる.

/// For instance, announcing a dinner selection may be done in two different ways: する is person-focused, while なる is situation-focused.

<br>

晩ご飯は和食にしました。//We’ve decided to serve Japanese food for dinner.

晩ご飯は和食になりました。//It was decided that the dinner would be Japanese food.

<br>

### (2) ことにする vs. ことになる

/// Earlier in this chapter, it was pointed out that in certain fixed expressions, the nominalizers こと and の are not interchangeable.

/// Nominalizing verbs preceding ~にする and ~になる represent one such case.

/// When a verb is used before する or なる, the nominalizer こと, rather than の, must precede the verb.

<br>

#### When to use which?

/// The implications of person-focused and situation-focused sentences are quite different.

/// In many cases, する is used to report a personal decision made in a certain situation.

/// In such a case, the addressee is probably aware of the options that the speaker had prior to making the decision reported.

<br>

明日、両親に電話することにしました。//I decided that I would call my parents tomorrow.

<br>

/// When なる is used, the speaker is reporting the objective outcome, rather than what the speaker has decided to do in a certain situation.

/// When such a construction as the one below is used, the matter sounds quite significant, because the implication is that it took much thought to arrive at the decision.

<br>

明日、両親に電話することになりました。//It’s been decided that I will call my parents tomorrow.

<br>

/// In some situations, the decision is not solely within the speaker’s control.

/// For instance, a situation such as graduating from school depends on many factors; it is not just a personal decision.

/// If the following statement were made, it would imply that the speaker has earned enough credits to graduate and that he or she has the option of when to graduate (not a common situation).

<br>

この六月に卒業することにしました。//I decided to graduate this June.

<br>

/// When publicly announcing a graduation (such as in an invitation card for a graduation party), the following expression with なる is much more appropriate.

/// Even though the speaker has not graduated yet, the main verb must be in the perfective aspect.

/// The perfective aspect here indicates that the decision has already been made about the coming commencement.

<br>

この六月に卒業することになりました。//I will be graduating this June.

<br>

#### Culturally speaking

/// Though it is largely situational, it is generally more appropriate to use なる when making a public announcement (e.g. wedding, graduation, starting school, starting a new job, etc.).

/// For personal matters, day-to-day decisions are more likely to be expressed with する (food, shopping, assignment, etc.).

/// When なる is used for daily decisions, it indicates that the decision is not a trivial one.

<br>

### (3) Revisiting transitive-intransitive verb pairs

/// As explained in earlier chapters, a few hundred transitive-intransitive pairs of verbs exist in Japanese.

/// In general, the transitive verbs of these pairs are used for person-focused expressions, while intransitives are situation-focused.

<br>

/// Depending on the situation, it may be more appropriate to use a transitive verb in some cases.

/// In other cases, the reverse is true.

/// The main point is that “who” did something can be expressed only via the use of transitive verbs.

<br>

/// If the speaker broke an important item—say, a cell phone–that his or her roommate treasured, how would he or she apologize for the mistake?

/// Using an intransitive verb would imply that the cell phone broke for an unfortunate reason (e.g. wind blew it off the table; a cat walked near it and knocked it off the table).

/// But when a transitive verb is used, it makes it obvious that the speaker did something like dropping it by mistake.

/// Therefore, the first example below would be more appropriate than the second.  ( 壊す {こわす} is transitive, while 壊れる {こわれる} is intransitive).

<br>

大切な携帯を壊してしまって、本当にごめんなさい。//I am so sorry I broke your precious cell phone.

<br>

/// In trying to comfort the person who is feeling bad about breaking the phone, one might make the following statement, using an intransitive verb:

<br>

携帯はよく壊れるから、私は何とも思っていませんよ。心配しないでください。//Cell phones break all the time, so I don’t think anything of it. Please don’t worry about it.

<br>

/// Imagine how the following inappropriate sentence using a transitive verb might sound to the addressee:

<br>

### (4) Transitive て-forms with ある (situation-focused)

/// The use of transitive verbs is by nature person-focused, because the verb implies that the topic operates on the object.

/// Transitive verbs can, however, be used for situation-focused expressions as well, with the following construction:

<br>

戸が開けてあります。//The door has been opened.

<br>

/// The construction above contains the conjunctive form of a transitive verb and ある.

/// Not all transitive verbs may be used in the above construction; it is limited to those transitive verbs that leave some kind of trace of the result of completing the action implied by the verb.

/// In the above sentence, someone opened the door (transitive act; person-focused) and the door is left standing open (situation-focused).

/// Even though the sentence implies that someone opened the door, it is not possible to articulate the person in this kind of construction.

<br>

/// Compare the following.

/// Although the verbs 書く and 飲む are both transitive, the てある-construction is acceptable with 書く, but not with 飲む.

/// This is because a name can be traced after someone has written it, but water cannot be traced after it is consumed.

<br>

ここに名前が書いてあります。//The name is written here.

<br>

## 4: なら-Adverbial as a Situational Condition

/// A number of conditional adverbial clauses have been introduced so far (e.g., clauses joined by とき, と, ~たら, ~ば);

/// each of these gives a distinct meaning to the preceding clause and connects it to the main clause.

/// It would be wise to review these clauses at this point to ensure that everything introduced has been clearly understood.

<br>

/// The most salient meaning of the なら-adverbial, as distinct from all the other conditionals,

/// is that the condition expressed in the なら-clause is how the speaker interprets a situation in the context of the speaker’s earlier deeds or statements (whether verbalized or assumed).

/// The speaker’s interpretation is offered as a possible condition for the consequence expressed in the main clause.

<br>

/// What this means is that the なら-conditional clause has a certain reference point (i.e., the previous statement, thought, etc.).

/// This is not true for other conditional clauses.

<br>

/// The なら-conditional clause is similar in nuance to the たら-conditional clause with the complex predicate with のだ.

<br>

あなたが行くのだったら、私は行きません。//If I understand that you are going to go, I will not go.

あなたが行くなら、私は行きません。//If it seems to me that you are going to go, I will not go.

<br>

/// の may be inserted between the clause and なら, emphasizing the speaker’s interpretation of the situation:

<br>

あなたが行くのなら、私は行きません。//I take it that you may go, and if that is in fact the case, I will not go.

あの授業がそんなに難しいのなら、辞めたらどうですか。//If the class is that difficult, why don’t you quit?

<br>

/// It is not incorrect to insert の with the nominal predicate, as seen below.

/// However, this is a rather awkward structure because there are too many clusters of elements that indicate the speaker’s personal interpretation.

/// Without の, the personal account is well expressed:

<br>

あの人が日本人なら、この仕事をあの人に頼みましょうか。//If that person is indeed Japanese, shall we ask her to do this job?

<br>

<br>

山田君、どこ？//Where is Yamada-kun?

ええ？山田君なら、もう帰っちゃいましたよ。//What? If you’re asking about Yamada-kun, he already went home.

ええ？もう、帰った？//He went home already?

ええ。また、怒ったんでしょ、きっと。//Yeah. I’m sure he got upset again!

<br>

#### ええ？

/// With a rising tone, this vocalization indicates that the speaker is quite surprised.

/// Greater surprise is expressed with a more drawn-out pronunciation.

<br>

#### A short でしょ

/// If she or he is upset, a speaker may cut でしょう rather short, following it immediately with the next word.

/// However, not every short でしょ indicates that the speaker is upset.

<br>

#### Word order inversion

/// The last line shows an inversion of the predicate and an adverb, きっと “surely.”

/// This kind of inversion occurs in conversation.

/// The last word is added as an afterthought, or to show that the speaker wants to emphasize the word.

<br>

### (2) A quick errand

<br>

ちょっと、お腹、すいたんで、出てきます。//I’m a little hungry, so I’m going to go out for a moment.

どこ、行くの？//Where are you going?

<br>

もう少し、いかがですか。//How about a little more?

ありがとうございます。これで十分です。//Thank you, but I’ve had plenty.

そうですか・・・でも、少しだけなら、大丈夫でしょう？//Really? But you can have just a bit more, can’t you?

いいえ、本当にもう結構です。//No, really, I’m fine.

<br>

#### これで十分です  {これでじゅうぶんです}

/// It is quite common for a Japanese host to offer things like food and drink repeatedly, even if the guest declines the offer.

/// This phrase, and もう結構です  {もうけっこうです} below, are typical ways to politely decline an offer.

<br>

/// 十分 {じゅうぶん} is an adjectival noun that means “sufficient; enough.”

/// これで十分です means “this is sufficient.”

/// で in this case indicates a boundary delimiting the amount that the speaker has.

<br>

#### もう結構です

/// This is another polite way to decline an offer.

/// The adjectival noun 結構 {けっこう} means “great; fine; excellent.”

/// With もう, the phrase means something like, “I’m fine with the way things are right now.”

/// The phrase 結構です may be used either for praising something or declining an offer, depending on the situation.

<br>

### (4) It’s my fault

<br>

どうしたんですか。何かあったんですか。//What’s wrong? Did something happen?

うん、ちょっと。日本語の試験の成績、本当にひどかったんです。//Yeah, kinda . . . I got an awful grade on my Japanese test.

/// うん、ちょっと is a way to give a vague answer to a question, especially if the speaker is put into a situation where he or she needs to explain something personal.stage ３，２。

# Stage 3-2 Making Inferences

## 1: Complex Predicates with そうだ

### (1) Overview

/// Complex predicates with such elements as そうだ, ようだ, and らしい express the speaker’s inferences based on different sources.

/// Some of these have been already introduced, and some are new.

<br>

/// The difference among the structures that express inferences lies in the source of information:

/// whether it is from an objective or subjective source, or the degree of objectivity or subjectivity of the information source.

<br>

/// The following illustrates the continuum of different information sources of the relevant elements of these structures.

<br>

/// Objective source

/// そうだ, らしい 

/// Subjective source

/// ようだ Stem + そう

<br>

/// Often, English expressions such as “it appears,” “it looks,” “it seems,” or “it is likely” are used to introduce complex predicate structures with the above elements.

/// A reminder here is that there is no absolute one-to-one correspondence between certain English translations and Japanese sentences (or vice versa),

/// so it is important to remember that learning the underlying meaning of each structure is far more powerful than learning structures via English translation.

<br>

### (2) Complex words with そう and complex predicates with そうだ

/// They look similar, but the information sources, as well as the structures, are quite different. Review the following.

<br>

/// A complex adjectival noun is derived by adding そう to the stem of a word, while a complex predicate is derived by adding そうだ to the original predicate.

/// The meanings are quite different.

<br>

あの人の作ったケーキはまずそうですね。//The cake that he made doesn’t look very appetizing, does it?

あの人の作ったケーキはまずいそうですね。//I heard that the cake that he made is unappetizing; is that right?

<br>

#### Information source

/// the objective information source is often expressed with によると and a complex predicate with そうだ.

/// However, the objective source cannot be expressed by the complex adjectival noun with そう.

/// This complex word is used only for information sources that are completely subjective.

<br>

山田さんの話によると、あの人の作ったケーキはまずいそうですね。//According to Yamada-san, the cake that he made is unappetizing, but is that really so?

<br>

### (3) Aspects of the two structures

/// The following sentences illustrate how aspects of the above two structures are expressed:

<br>

#### Negative sentences containing complex words with そう

/// There are two ways to negate a sentence containing a complex adjectival noun with そう.

/// The first is to use the negative of the original word and add そう. Recall that さ must be inserted between the negative な~ and そう.

/// This is true with all negatives and the positive adjective いい, which is よさそう.

<br>

雨が降らなさそうです。//It looks to me like it’s not going to rain any time soon.

<br>

/// The second way is to form a complex adjectival noun first and then negate the predicate.

<br>

雨が降りそうじゃありません。//It doesn’t look to me like it’s going to rain any time soon.

<br>

/// There is a difference in meaning between the two negative sentences above:

/// the first sentence above expresses the speaker’s own observation that it might not rain

/// while the second sentence is the speaker’s negation of a previous statement or inference (which could include the speaker’s own inference prior to the observation).

<br>

#### Positive and negative perfective sentences containing complex words with そう

/// The positive perfective is indicated by the predicate; this is the only way to express this aspect.

/// In other words, it is not possible to put the original word into the perfective form before adding そう in this structure.

<br>

雨が降りそうでした。//It looked to me like it was going to rain soon.

<br>

/// There are two ways to form negative perfective sentences with complex adjectival nouns with そう.

/// These are the same as the ways of forming imperfective negative sentences; the only difference is that でした is added.

/// The difference in nuance between the two is the same as for negative imperfectives.

<br>

雨が降らなさそうでした。//It looked to me like it wasn’t going to rain any time soon.

雨が降りそうじゃありませんでした。//It didn’t look to me like it was going to rain any time soon.

<br>

#### Indicating aspect in complex predicates with そうだ

/// Because そうだ at the end of a complex predicate does not convey when the information was obtained, aspect cannot be expressed by this element.

/// In constructions including the complex predicate with そうだ, the most natural way to indicate aspect is therefore to express it in the first predicate within the complex predicate.

<br>

午後は雨が降らないそうです。//I heard that it’s not going to rain in the afternoon.

午後は雨が降ったそうです。//I heard that it rained in the afternoon.

午後は雨が降らなかったそうです。//I heard that it didn’t rain this afternoon.

今は日本でも雨が降っているそうです。//I heard that it’s raining in Japan now, too.

<br>

## 2: Complex Predicates with ようだ

/// Complex predicates with ようだ were mentioned in Stages 1–7 and 2–5, but the ways in which this structure is used have not been covered.

/// In fact, よう is used in quite a few ways in various structures.

<br>

### (1) The use of よう in complex predicates

/// The word よう literally means “appearance.” The use of よう in the complex predicate therefore indicates that the event that the sentence refers to is based on an inference drawn from the speaker’s direct perception of a situation.

/// The information may be from an objective source as well, but the speaker must still confirm it through his or her own direct observation.

<br>

#### Predicates before ようだ

/// The following examples illustrate the use of all three predicates before ようだ.

<br>

午後、雨が降るようです。//It looks like it will rain this afternoon.

あの店のお茶はおいしいようです。//The tea at that shop looks delicious.

ここは静かなようです。//It seems like this place is quiet.

あの人は日本人のようです。//That person looks Japanese.

<br>

/// In the following section, different aspects of this construction are presented.

/// The same content, that is, “rain in the afternoon,” will be used in all cases so that the comparison will be clearer.

<br>

#### Negative aspects

/// A structure in which the predicate before ようだ is negative is different in meaning from one in which ようだ itself is negative.

<br>

/// When the predicate before ようだ is negative, the speaker is stating her or his observation.

<br>

午後、雨が降らないようです。//It looks like it won’t rain this afternoon.

<br>

/// When ようだ is negative, the speaker is negating the assumption that it may rain.

<br>

午後、雨が降るようではありません。//It doesn’t look like it will rain this afternoon.

<br>

#### Positive perfective aspect

/// Structures that use the perfective in the predicate before ようだ are different in meaning from those that use ようだ in the perfective.

<br>

/// When the positive aspect is expressed in the predicate before ようだ, the speaker is informing the addressee that he or she believes that it rained in the afternoon.

<br>

午後、雨が降ったようです。//It looks like it rained in the afternoon.

<br>

/// When ようだ is in the perfective, it refers to a certain past situation in which the speaker reports that it looked as if it would rain in the afternoon.

/// For instance, if the speaker is talking about the previous weekend, by using this structure, she or he is saying that it looked like rain then.

<br>

午後、雨が降るようでした。//It looked like it was going to rain in the afternoon.

<br>

/// The following illustrates when both predicates are positive perfective.

<br>

午後、雨が降ったようでした。//It looked like it had rained in the afternoon.

<br>

#### Negative perfective aspect

/// With this aspect, the difference in meaning depends on the place of negation.

/// The difference is similar to the difference between negative imperfectives.

<br>

午後、雨が降らなかったようです。//It looks like it didn’t rain in the afternoon.

午後、雨が降るようじゃありませんでした。//It didn’t look like it would rain in the afternoon.

<br>

/// When referring to a situation in the past, the following structures are possible.

/// The first sentence indicates that the speaker observed in the past that it would not rain, while the second one conveys the speaker’s past observation that it did not rain.

<br>

午後、雨が降らないようでした。//It looked like it wouldn’t rain in the afternoon.

午後、雨が降らなかったようでした。//It looked like it hadn’t rained in the afternoon.

<br>

### (2) Complex words with そう and complex predicates with ようだ

/// For both structures—complex adjectival nouns with そう and complex predicates with ようだ—the information source is subjective.

<br>

#### Time of events

/// Despite this similarity, there are some important differences.

/// The sentence with the complex adjectival noun conveys “immediacy”—something like “it looks as if the rain will come very soon.”

/// It also expresses the speaker’s strong prediction if immediacy is not included.

/// With complex predicates containing ようだ, these implications are not conveyed.

<br>

雨が降りそうです。//It looks like it’s going to rain any minute now.

明日も雨が降るようです。//It looks like it’s going to rain tomorrow, too.

<br>

/// Compare the following examples.

<br>

このすしは本当においしそうですねえ。//This sushi looks really delicious!

あそこのすしは本当においしいようですねえ。//Sushi at that restaurant is supposed to be quite good.

<br>

/// The first sentence with the complex word with そう is used when something—sushi, in this case— is right in front of the speaker.

/// The second sentence containing the complex predicate with ようだ is an inference made by the speaker based on what he or she has heard or witnessed.

<br>

#### Information source

/// Though complex adjectival nouns with そう and complex predicates with ようだ are based on a subjective information source, the latter may also include an objective source.

<br>

/// Because complex predicates with ようだ may contain combined information sources, an objective source may be expressed with this construction.

/// This is not possible, however, with the complex adjectival noun with そう.

<br>

テレビによると、午後、雨が降るようです。//According to the TV, it’s supposed to rain in the afternoon.

<br>

#### A conversational function of ようだ

/// When the speaker wishes to make an assertion, she or he may choose to add ようだ at the end of sentence to soften the assertion.

/// For instance, the use of ようだ adds the nuance that the speaker agrees with something based on his or her own direct observation.

<br>

/// For instance, the following examples show that the one with 思います is much stronger than そのよ うです when expressing agreement.

<br>

あの人は困っているようですね。//She is in trouble, isn’t she?

そう思います。//I think so.

そのようですね。//It seems that way, doesn’t it?

<br>

#### Emotive expressions with ようだ

/// Similar to the way in which a third person’s emotions may be reported with 言う and 思う, the use of ようだ is also appropriate when the speaker has witnessed a third person’s emotions directly. 

<br>

### (3) みたいだ and ようだ

/// Though more colloquial in tone, complex predicates with みたいだ express the same degree of subjectivity and objectivity with regard to the information source as those with ようだ.

/// The following examples illustrate that there is no structural difference between sentences with みたい and ようだ when the predicate is verbal or adjectival.

/// There is, however, a structural difference when the predicate is nominal.

<br>

午後、雨が降るようです。//It looks like it’s going to rain this afternoon.

午後、雨が降るみたいです。//It looks like it’s going to rain this afternoon.

<br>

あの店のお茶はおいしいようです。//The tea at that shop looks delicious.

あの店のお茶はおいしいみたいです。//The tea at that shop looks delicious.

<br>

ここは静かなようです。//This place seems quiet.

ここは静かみたいです。//This place seems quiet.

<br>

あの人は日本人のようです。//That person looks Japanese.

あの人は日本人みたいです。//That person looks Japanese.

<br>

## 3: Different Uses of よう

/// The following sections discuss uses of よう other than ようだ in complex predicates.

<br>

### (1) Adjectival and adverbial phrases with よう and みたい

#### Similes with よう and みたい

/// Similes may be expressed with よう or みたい. な is needed to join either word to the noun that follows.

/// Though it is not necessary to use の between みたい and the preceding noun, の is necessary for よう.

<br>

あの人は先生のような人ですね。//That person acts like a teacher, doesn’t he?

あの人は先生みたいな人ですね。//That person acts like a teacher, doesn’t he?

<br>

あのコーヒーのような飲み物は何ですか。//What is that coffee-like drink?

あのコーヒーみたいな飲み物は何ですか。//What is that coffee-like drink?

<br>

#### よう and みたい representing a category

<br>

/// The noun followed by よう or みたい represents a category.

<br>

北川さんのような人は嫌いです。//I can’t stand people like Kitagawa-san.

北川さんみたいな人は嫌いです。//I can’t stand people like Kitagawa-san.

<br>

和食のような物を作りました。//I made something that looks like Japanese food.

和食みたいな物を作りました。//I made something that looks like Japanese food.

<br>

#### Adverbial similes with よう and みたい

/// Similes may be expressed adverbially using よう or みたい. In this case, に must be used to make the よう-phrase an adverbial one.

/// ぶた in the third and fourth examples means “pig.”

<br>

あの学生は日本人のように日本語を話しますね。//That student speaks Japanese just like a native, doesn’t she?

あの学生は日本人みたいに日本語を話しますね。//That student speaks Japanese just like a native, doesn’t she?

<br>

昨日、ぶたのようにたくさん食べました。//I ate like a pig yesterday.

昨日、ぶたみたいにたくさん食べました。//I ate like a pig yesterday.

<br>

#### まるで・・・よう（な・に） or みたい（な・に）

/// The adverb まるで may be added in the sentences above to emphasize the degree of similarity of the things being compared.

<br>

あのアメリカ人はまるで日本人のようなアメリカ人ですね。//That American is just like a Japanese person.

あのアメリカ人はまるで日本人みたいなアメリカ人ですね。//That American is just like a Japanese person.

<br>

昨日、まるでぶたのようにたくさん食べました。//I ate so much yesterday, like an absolute pig.

昨日、まるでぶたみたいにたくさん食べました。//I ate so much yesterday, like an absolute pig.

<br>

### (2) ように expressing a goal

/// A target or a goal may be expressed with ように.

/// In this case, the predicate before ように must be imperfective.

<br>

試験に合格するように毎日、一生懸命に勉強しています。//I’ve been studying hard every day so I can pass the examination.

あまり太らないように毎日、運動しています。//I’ve been exercising every day so I won’t get fat.

<br>

### (3) ようにする expressing effort

/// In this construction, the verb, whether positive or negative, must be in the imperfective form.

/// This structure indicates that the speaker is making an effort to do or not do something.

<br>

もっと勉強するようにします。//I will try to study more.

<br>

/// Adverbs such as なるべく “as much as possible” often accompany this structure.

/// The following sentence illustrates the negative aspect as well.

<br>

なるべく遊ばないようにします。//I will make an effort to play as little as possible.

<br>

/// The adverbial phrase できるだけ “as much as possible” is more colloquial than なるべく used above.

/// The following sentence illustrates the negative perfective aspect:

<br>

できるだけ、あの人とは話さないようにしました。//I tried to speak to that person as little as possible.

<br>

#### ようになる

/// Since the expressions above convey that the speaker is making an effort, they are person-focused expressions.

/// Compare them to the following sentences with ようになる, which are all situation-focused.

/// It may be helpful to remember that the verb なる is used to indicate situational changes.

<br>

あの人とあまり遊ばないようになりました。//Things have changed, and I don’t play with him anymore.

あの人とは話さないようになりました。//As things stand now, I no longer speak to him.

<br>

#### ようにする and ~てみる

/// The sentences with ようにする introduced above, especially the positive ones, may seem similar to structures with ~てみる, primarily because both structures are commonly expressed with the English verb “try.”

/// However, while the expression with ~てみる focuses on the result of the action of studying,

/// the structure ようにする focuses on the effort to do the studying, and the actual action of studying has not taken place.

<br>

もっと勉強してみます。//I will try studying more.

/// Literally, “I will see how it turns out after studying more.”

<br>

もっと勉強するようにします。//I will try to study more.

/// Literally, “I will make an effort to study more.”

<br>

### (4) Volitional とする

/// Yet another structure exists that is similar to the two structures above.

/// When the volitional form is used with the particle と and the verb する, usually in its perfective form, the combination indicates that the speaker made an effort to do something, but the action was not successfully carried out as a result.

/// In these sentences, the implication is that the speaker was never able to carry out the act expressed in the adverbial clauses.

<br>

晩ご飯を食べようとしましたが、食べられませんでした。//I tried to eat my dinner, but I couldn’t do it.

電話をしようとしましたが、時間がありませんでした。//I meant to call you last night, but I didn’t have time.

<br>

#### Differences in sentences with ようにする, volitional とする（した）, and てみる

/// Compare the following three structures.

/// Although it is possible for all three of the sentences below to be expressed with the English verb “try,” students should be mindful of the underlying meaning of each Japanese sentence.

<br>

野菜を食べるようにしました。//I tried to eat the vegetables.

/// Literally, “I made an effort to eat the vegetables.”

<br>

野菜を食べようとしました。//I tried to eat the vegetables.

/// Literally, “I was about to eat the vegetables, but was unable to.”

<br>

野菜を食べてみました。//I tried eating the vegetables.

/// Literally, “I ate the vegetables and saw how they were.

<br>

## 4: Complex Predicates with らしい

/// Complex predicates with らしい are closest in meaning to those with そうだ.

/// Both structures imply that the information source is an objective one.

/// Structures with そうだ, however, merely report the information; no confirmation of the information by the speaker is implied.

/// With らしい, this confirmation is expressed.

<br>

### (1) Structures with らしい

/// As with complex predicates with そうだ, aspect is not reflected in the predicate with らしい.

/// Instead, all aspectual forms are included in the predicate before らしい.

/// The following examples show various types of predicates and different aspects.

<br>

午後、雨が降るらしいです。//It seems like it’s going to rain this afternoon.

午後、雨は降らないらしいです。//It seems like it’s not going to rain this afternoon.

あの店のお茶はおいしいらしいです。//It seems like tea at that shop is delicious.

あの店のお茶はおいしかったらしいです。//It seems like tea at that shop was delicious.

ここは静からしいです。//It seems like this place is quiet.

ここは静かじゃなかったらしいです。//It seems that the place wasn’t quiet.

あの人は日本人らしいです。//It seems like that person is Japanese.

あの人は日本人じゃないらしいです。//It seems like that person is not Japanese.

<br>

### (2) Complex adjectives with らしい

/// らしい is also used to form complex adjectives.

<br>

/// In the following example, 日本人らしい is a complex adjective conveying that the topic satisfies every criterion of what a Japanese person ought to be.

<br>

あの女の人は日本人らしいですねえ。//That woman acts very Japanese, doesn’t she?

<br>

/// When written, there is no difference between the forms of a complex adjective with らしい and a complex predicate with らしい.

/// Only the context in which a sentence is used will indicate whether it is used as a complex predicate or a complex adjective.

<br>

あの女の人は日本人らしいですねえ。//That woman seems to be a Japanese, doesn’t she?

<br>

/// In speaking, there is a difference in pause and pitches between the complex adjective and the complex predicate.

/// Since the complex adjective is an independent word, there is no pause in pronunciation between 日本人and らしい.

/// Therefore, the pitch used between 日本人and らしい is continuous.

/// When らしい is in the predicate, there should be a break or pause in pronunciation between 日本人 and らしい, even if it is a very brief pause.

<br>

/// The following sentence illustrates how the complex adjective with らしい modifies a noun.

/// Here, あの人 is a teacher who speaks as one would expect a teacher to do.

<br>

あの人は先生らしい話し方をしますね。//That person speaks in a very teacher-like manner.

<br>

/// Compare the following sentence with the one above.

/// Here, あの人 is not a teacher, or the speaker is not certain if あの人 is a teacher but she speaks as if she were one.

<br>

あの人は先生のような話し方をしますね。//That person talks like a teacher.

<br>

### (3) Adverbs with らしく

/// Complex adjectives with らしい are used as adverbs by changing the final い to く.

<br>

あの人はいつもとても女性らしく話します。//The way she speaks is always very feminine.

大学内では学生らしく行動してください。//Please behave the way a student should on campus.

<br>

### (4) Comparison of the four structures

/// The differences in the four structures are compared in the following chart:

<br>

#### そうだ

/// Source of information -> Objective: Entirely, Subjective: Not at all

/// Features -> Reporting objectively, No confirmation

<br>

#### らしい

/// Source of information -> Objective: Mostly, Subjective: A little

/// Features -> Reporting objectively, Confirmation by the speaker

<br>

#### ようだ

/// Source of information -> Objective: A little, Subjective: Mostly

/// Features -> Inference based on the speaker’s direct observation

<br>

#### Stem + そう

/// Source of information -> Objective: Not at all, Subjective: Entirely

/// Features -> Inference based on the speaker’s direct observation Immediacy

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

カンバセーション。

<br>

### (1) It seems that way

<br>

加藤さん、婚約したんだって！//I heard that Kato-san got engaged!

そうらしいねえ。//I heard that, too.

結婚はいつなのかな。//I wonder when the wedding will be.

秋らしいよ。//I heard it’s in the fall.

<br>

#### 婚約したんだって！

/// 婚約する {こんやくする} means “to get engaged.”

/// 婚約したんだって is a shortened version of 婚約したのだと聞きました “I heard from someone that someone else got engaged.”

<br>

#### そうらしい

/// This phrase is often used to agree with the addressee’s statement.

/// The phrase literally means “it seems that way.”

<br>

### (2) As I said earlier

<br>

やっと、運転免許が取れたよ。今度の土曜日、ドライブに行かない？//I finally got my drivers’ license. Do you want to go for a ride this Saturday?

よかったわね。でも、今度の土曜日はちょっと・・・//That’s great! But this Saturday isn’t a good time for me.

都合が悪いの？残念だなあ。今、紅葉がきれいだということだから・・・//It’s not? Too bad. I heard the autumn foliage is really pretty now.

さっきも言ったように、土曜日はちょっと、都合が悪いの。//As I said, Saturday won’t work for me.

<br>

#### 運転免許（うんてんめんきょ）

/// 免許（めんきょ） refers to any kind of “certificate.” Here, the combination means “drivers’ license.”

<br>

#### ドライブに行く

/// This indicates a ride taken in an automobile for pleasure.

<br>

#### 都合が悪い

/// 都合（つごう） is a noun that means “the personal circumstances that may or may not be convenient for a certain event.”

/// 都合がいい is used when there is no conflict, and 都合が悪い {つごう が わるい} is used when there is conflict.

<br>

#### 紅葉（こうよう）

/// The kanji 紅 indicates the color red; the second kanji 葉 means “leaves.”

/// Together, it means “red leaves,” referring to the autumn foliage.

<br>

#### (3) She seems so Japanese

<br>

ブラウンさん、本当に日本語がペラペラですね。//Brown-san is so fluent in Japanese!

本当に。まるで、日本人ですね、彼女は。//She really is. She’s just like a Japanese person.

でも、日本食にはなかなか苦労しているようですよ。//But I heard she has a hard time with Japanese food.

そうなんですか。//Is that so?

<br>

#### 苦労する

/// 苦労 {くろう} means “hardship.” It can be used for many different situations.

/// Here, the word refers to a person having a difficult time with Japanese food.

/// The word may be used to refer to hardship in personal relations as well.

/// In all cases, the particle に is used for the things that a person is having a hard time with.

<br>

#### まるで日本人ですね

/// In the grammar section of this chapter, まるで is introduced with みたい and よう, but in the above sentence, neither is used.

/// In conversation, this deletion is frequent. Here, the meaning of よう or みたい is implied.stage ３，３。

# Stage 3-3 Embedded Information

<br>

## 1: Embedded Clauses

/// Embedded clauses are the clauses that are buried in certain structures.

/// Quite a few structures with embedded clauses have already been introduced so far.

<br>

/// In this section, the focus will be on how embedded clauses connect to main predicates and modify nouns.

<br>

### (1) Review

#### The use of と when reporting

/// Some quotes or thoughts may be conveyed by such verbs as 言う {いう}, 思う {おもう}, and 聞く {きく}.

/// The content of quotes (direct or indirect) or thoughts is connected to the final verb by the particle と.

<br>

日本語は難しい言葉だと言われています。//It has been said that Japanese is a difficult language.

日本語はそんなに難しい言葉だとは思いません。//I don’t think Japanese is such a difficult language.

あの人は一年生だと聞きました。//I heard that that person is a freshman.

<br>

#### Using か in embedded questions

/// When the content of the speaker’s report is a question, か overrides と.

/// In the sentence below, the speaker summarizes the content.

<br>

あの人に明日は何をするつもりか聞きました。//I asked that person what he was planning to do tomorrow.

<br>

/// When と is added to the sentence above, the meaning changes, making the sentence sound more like a verbatim quote than the speaker’s summary of the content.

<br>

あの人に明日は何をするつもりかと聞きました。//I asked that person, ‘What are you planning to do tomorrow?’

<br>

#### Adjectival clauses

/// Adjectival clauses are embedded clauses that modify the nouns that follow them.

/// The way such a clause is connected to the noun depends on the predicate type in the embedded clause.

/// The following sentences illustrate, in order, the nominal (both noun and adjectival noun), adjectival, and verbal predicate types that are used in embedded clauses.

/// All adjectival clauses in the following examples modify the noun ルームメート.

<br>

私は専攻が日本語のルームメートと一緒に住んでいます。//I live with a roommate whose major is Japanese.

僕は魚が嫌いなルームメートと一緒に住んでいます。//I live with a roommate who doesn’t like fish.

姉は髪が長いルームメートと一緒に住んでいます。//My sister lives with a roommate who has long hair.

兄は皆に頭がいいと言われているルームメートと一緒に住んでいます。//My brother lives with a roommate who everyone says is smart.

<br>

### (2) の・こと・ということ

/// In the following examples, the functional noun こと and the pronoun の are modified by adjectival clauses.

/// As explained in Stage 3–1, the difference between the use of の and こと is that の would imply that the speaker heard Nakada-san playing the piano directly,

/// while こと would imply that the speaker heard from someone else that Nakada-san has been or is playing the piano.

<br>

私は中田さんがピアノをひいているのを聞きました。//I heard Nakada-san playing the piano.

私は中田さんがピアノをひいていることを聞きました。//I heard that Nakada-san is playing the piano.

<br>

/// In embedded clauses connected by こと and those connected by ということ,

/// the difference is that こと is used to convey a fact,

/// while ということ is used to paraphrase the speaker’s interpretation of information.

<br>

私は中田さんがピアノをひいているということを聞きました。//I heard something to the effect that Nakada-san is playing the piano.

<br>

/// In Stage 2–2, the use of こと and ということ was introduced to define a word or a concept.

/// When defining a word by the use of a noun or a noun phrase, ことmay be used in the predicate.

/// See the following example.

<br>

和食は日本の食べ物のことです。//'washoku' refers to food from Japan.

<br>

/// When defining a word by the use of a clause, ということ may be used in the predicate.

/// See the following:

<br>

読書は本を読むということです。//'dokusho' means reading books.

<br>

#### ということ with the verb 知る

/// In the following sentences with the verb 知る {しる}, the thing that the speaker knows is the direct object, which is marked by を.

<br>

私はあの人の名前を知っています。//I know his name.

<br>

/// When the direct object is a clause rather than a noun, ということ must be used:

<br>

私はあの人が一年生だということを知っています。//I know that that person is a freshman.

<br>

## 2: わけ and というわけ

### (1) わけ as an independent noun

/// わけ is a noun that means “interpretation,” “explanation,” or “reason.”

/// The following examples show how this word is used as a noun.

/// When used as a noun, わけ may be expressed in kanji as 訳.

<br>

そのわけが分からない。//I don’t understand the reason.

そのわけを教えて下さい。//Tell me why you think so.

<br>

/// Two fixed expressions in which わけ is used are introduced in the following section.

/// When わけ is used in fixed expressions or in the predicate position, it is not written in kanji.

<br>

#### Fixed expressions with わけがない

/// わけ in this construction means something more like “a way to interpret something.”

/// The fixed expression わけがない literally means “it is not possible to interpret the given situation”;

/// the specific circumstances that are impossible are expressed in the embedded clause that modifies the noun わけ.

<br>

子供にこんな難しい漢字が読めるわけがない。//A child couldn’t read such a difficult kanji.

/// Literally, “it is not possible for a child to be able to read such a difficult kanji.”

<br>

/// The entire embedded clause may be referred to by a pronoun in this construction.

/// Suppose someone has said something, and the speaker wants to respond strongly that what was said is not possible.

<br>

そんなわけがありません。//That is inconceivable.

/// Literally, “Such a thing is not possible.”

<br>

/// が, of course, may be topicalized for a stronger negation.

<br>

そんなわけはありません。//That is absolutely inconceivable.

/// Literally, “Such a thing is not at all possible.”

<br>

#### Fixed expressions with わけにいかない

/// The fixed expression わけにいかない means something like “(the speaker) cannot possibly do (a certain thing)”

/// or “circumstances do not allow the speaker to do such-and-such.”

<br>

今日、そこに行くわけにいきません。//There’s no way that I can go there today.

<br>

/// Because the predicate is in the negative form, は often accompanies に for contrast.

<br>

今日、そこに行くわけにはいきません。//There’s no way that I can go there today.

<br>

/// The verb before わけに（は）いかない must indicate an action that the speaker has control over.

<br>

/// the verb 分かる is a non-action verb.

/// In such a case, はず should be used.

/// Recall that はず is used when the speaker expects a certain event, situation, or result.

/// In the example below, however, はずだ is in the negative.

<br>

私にそれが分かるはずはありません。//I cannot possibly comprehend that.

<br>

### (2) Complex predicates with わけだ

/// Since the noun わけ means “reason,” the complex predicate with わけだ can provide a reason or interpretation.

<br>

あの人は中国人だから、漢字がよく読めるわけです。//The reason that person can read kanji so well is because he is Chinese.

<br>

/// This structure is similar to the complex predicate with の（ん）だ, which also provides a reason or interpretation.

/// Reasoning or interpretation in the complex predicate with のだ, however, indicates a personal explanation,

/// while the reasoning in the complex predicate with わけ refers to an objective interpretation of circumstances.

<br>

昨日、どうして授業に来ませんでしたか。//Why didn’t you come to class yesterday?

<br>

/// In responding to the above question, using のだ sounds better than using わけ,

/// because the speaker is giving a direct personal account of the reason.

<br>

頭が痛かったんです。//Because I had a headache.

<br>

#### という in complex predicates with わけだ

/// Recall that という, with a clause, is used to define a word.

/// In the same way, という is often used to connect the content of the message, which is often an embedded clause, to the predicate with わけだ.

<br>

車が途中で故障して、遅れてしまったというわけです。//The reason I was late is because the car broke down on the way.

<br>

/// In addition, というわけ is often used in questions that ask the addressee to confirm the speaker’s interpretation of the circumstances.

<br>

時間がなかったから電話ができなかったというわけですか。//Are you saying that you couldn’t call me because you didn’t have enough time?

彼が日本にいたから日本語が上手だというわけですか。//Do you mean to say that his Japanese is good because he has been to Japan?

<br>

/// In conversation, it is normal to abbreviate the response by using pronouns.

/// In these cases, the particle と is not used before いう.

<br>

ええ、そういうわけです。//Yes, that’s what I am saying.

/// or “Yes, that’s what I mean.”

<br>

いいえ、そういうわけでは（じゃ）ありません。//No, that’s not what I am saying.

/// or “No, that’s not what I meant.”

<br>



## 3: Embedded Questions

/// Most of the following structures have been already introduced, but there are some important additions below.

/// The following section summarizes all embedded question types.

<br>

### (1) Embedded information-seeking questions

/// The following sentences illustrate how direct and indirect questions are expressed.

/// In indirect questions, there is a difference between the sentences with the quotative と and those without it.

<br>

#### Direct quotation

<br>

友達が私に「この大学の日本語の先生はだれですか。」と聞きました。//My friend asked me, ‘Who is the professor of Japanese at this college?’

友達が「今晩、何をしますか。」と聞きました。//My friend asked me, ‘What will you do tonight?’

<br>

#### Indirect quotation

/// In embedded questions, か must always be used.

/// When と is used after か, the sentence focuses on how the question was asked.

/// When と is not used after か, the sentence conveys the general content of the question.

/// The sentences with both か and と are somewhere between direct and indirect quotation sentences.

<br>

友達が私にこの大学の日本語の先生はだれか（と）聞きました。//My friend asked me who the professor of Japanese at this college is.

友達が今晩、何をするか（と）聞きました。//My friend asked me what I would do tonight.

<br>

### (2) Embedded yes-no questions

/// The following examples show that the copula だ is not used in an indirect quotation, and that どうか may be added after the embedded question.

/// When どうか is used, the quotative と is not used.

<br>

#### Direct quotation

<br>

友達は私に「この大学の日本語の先生は日本人ですか。」と聞きました。//My friend asked me, ‘Is the professor of Japanese at this college a Japanese person?’

<br>

#### Indirect quotation

<br>

友達は私にこの大学の日本語の先生は日本人か（と）聞きました。//My friend asked me, ‘Is the professor of Japanese at this college a Japanese person?’

友達は私にこの大学の日本語の先生は日本人かどうか聞きました。//My friend asked me whether the professor of Japanese at this college is Japanese or not.

<br>

### (3) Embedded alternative questions

/// For embedded alternative questions, either use どうか after the first question, or list two questions side by side if both use the same predicates with different aspects.

/// When listing two questions, the use of と conveys information as to how the question was worded rather than the content of the question.

<br>

#### Direct quotation

<br>

私は友達に「明日、映画に行きますか、行きませんか。」と聞きました。//I asked my friend, ‘Do you want to go to a movie tomorrow or not?’

<br>

#### Indirect quotation

<br>

私は友達に明日、映画に行くかどうか聞きました。//I asked my friend whether or not she would go to a movie tomorrow.

私は友達に明日、映画に行くか行かないか（と）聞きました。//I asked my friend whether or not she would go to a movie tomorrow.

<br>

/// The following sentences illustrate that the alternative question does not always contain the same predicate as the first question.

/// In such cases, どうか may not be used.

<br>

#### Direct quotation

<br>

友達に「あなたのお母さんは日本人ですか、アメリカ人ですか。」と聞きました。//I asked my friend, ‘Is your mother Japanese or American?’

<br>

#### Indirect quotation

<br>

私は友達に彼のお母さんは日本人かアメリカ人か（と）聞きました。//I asked my friend if his mother was Japanese or American.

<br>

## 4: Adjectival Clauses

/// It has already been pointed out that embedded clauses are frequently adjectival clauses.

/// The following section introduces new information regarding embedded clauses that are adjectival clauses.

<br>

### (1) Fixed expressions

#### [Imperfective verb] ことがある

/// As explained in Stage 2–2, a perfective verb with ことがある expresses the topic’s past experience.

<br>

あの山に登ったことがあります。//I have climbed that mountain.

/// Literally, “I have had the experience of climbing that mountain in the past.”

<br>

/// When an imperfective predicate is used before ことがある, it expresses an entirely different concept.

/// When the verb before ことがある is in the imperfective, it refers to events that take place occasionally.

<br>

母に日本語で話すことがあります。//There are occasions when I speak to my mother in Japanese.

<br>

/// The sentence above conveys the following nuance:

/// the speaker normally speaks to her or his mother in English (or another non-Japanese language, depending on the context),

/// but there are some occasions on which the speaker talks to her or his mother in Japanese.

<br>

/// The following sentence illustrates a negative imperfective verb being used before ことがある.

/// This sentence implies that the speaker normally eats breakfast, but there are occasions when he or she skips it.

<br>

朝ご飯を食べないことがあります。//There are times that I don’t eat breakfast.

<br>

### (2) Perfective forms in adjectival clauses

/// One of the uses of the ~ている construction is to express a state of events.

<br>

私の父はぼうしをかぶっています。//My father has a hat on.

<br>

/// An interesting characteristic of this structure is that the perfective predicate may be used for description.

/// This is only true with adjectival clauses, however.

<br>

あのぼうしをかぶっている人は私の父です。//The person who has a hat on is my father.

あのぼうしをかぶった人は私の父です。//The person who has a hat on is my father.

<br>

/// This may not be applied to ~ている constructions that are not descriptive in nature.

<br>

ルームメートは起きています。//My roommate is awake.

あの起きている学生が私のルームメートです。//The student who is up is my roommate.

<br>

### (3) Double questions

/// The structure discussed here is quite unique.

/// The following question sentences contain both yes-no and information-seeking questions.

/// Let us call these kinds of question sentences “double questions.”

/// In these sentences, the embedded clause and the main clause are both interrogative clauses.

<br>

このバスはどこに行くバスですか。//Where is it that this bus goes?

/// Literally, “This bus is the bus that goes where?”

<br>

あの先生は何を教えている先生ですか。//What is it that that teacher teaches?

/// Literally, “That teacher is the teacher who teaches what?”

<br>

/// Double questions are used when at least some of the possible options are known to the speaker, and she or he asks for the answer to a specific option.

/// For instance, the person asking the first question above knows that there are a certain number of possible destinations for the buses.

/// The reading of the second sentence is the same: the options are at least somewhat known to the speaker and the addressee.

<br>

/// When the options are not known, the following simple question sentences are used instead of the double questions above, making them open-ended questions.

<br>

このバスはどこに行きますか。//Where does this bus go?

あの先生は何を教えていますか。//What does that teacher teach?

<br>

#### A possible situation for a double question

/// Suppose the speaker is waiting for a bus because she wants to go to destination A.

/// She knows that there are three buses that go to different destinations from the bus stop where she is waiting.

/// She sees a bus coming to the stop.

/// When the bus arrives, she approaches the bus driver and asks where that particular bus is going, in order to see whether or not it is the right bus for her.

/// In this case, she can use the double question construction.

<br>

このバスはどこに行くバスですか。//Which way is it that this bus is going?

<br>

/// Because of the nature of double questions, if the noun the embedded question clause modifies is a specific noun, a double question is not acceptable.

/// In this case, it is better to simply ask the open-ended question.

<br>

あなたのお父さんは何を教えていますか。//What does your father teach?

<br>

## 5: Volitional Forms in Embedded Clauses

/// The meaning of phrases in which volitional forms are used differs depending on the verb that accompanies the volitional form.

/// The volitional form with the verb する was introduced in Stage 3–2.

/// Another structure will be added in this chapter, after a review of direct and indirect quotations with a volitional form in the predicate.

<br>

### (1) The volitional form in quotes

/// The following sentences contain direct and indirect quotes with predicates in which volitional forms are used.

<br>

#### Direct quotation

<br>

私はルームメートに「一緒に映画に行きましょう。」と誘いました。//I invited my roommate, saying, ‘Let’s go to the movie together.’

<br>

#### Indirect quotation

<br>

私はルームメートに一緒に映画に行こうと誘いました。//I invited my roommate to go to the movie with me.

<br>

### (2) The volitional form with 思う

/// The volitional form is used with 思う to express the speaker’s intention.

/// In this structure, the continuous 思っている is often used to express a thought regarding an action in the near future.

<br>

今晩、映画に行こうと思っています。//I’m thinking about going to a movie tonight.

<br>

/// The use of the volitional form and 思う is similar to the structure with つもり that expresses the speaker’s plan.

/// The difference between the two structures is that the sentence with つもり implies that the plan is firm,

/// while the volitional form with 思う gives the impression that it is still a tentative plan.

<br>

今晩、映画に行くつもりです。//I’m planning to go to a movie tonight.

<br>

/// When the predicate form before 思う is not in the volitional form,

/// the sentence indicates that the speaker thinks that someone else will go to the movie;

/// there is no possibility that it is the speaker who might go to the movie.

<br>

田村さんは今晩、映画に行くと思います。//I think that Tamura-san will go to a movie tonight.

<br>

/// The above sentence indicates that the speaker believes that 田村さん {たむらさん} will go to the movie.

/// Even when the person who will go to the movie is not named, the sentence still does not mean that it is the speaker who will go to the movie.

<br>

今晩、映画に行くと思います。//I think that (someone) will go to a movie tonight.

<br>

### (3) The volitional form with する

/// In Stage 3–2, it was explained that combining the volitional form and the verb する expresses the notion that the speaker was about to take some action, but could not (which is expressed in the main-clause).

<br>

買い物に行こうとしましたが、友達が来て、行けませんでした。//I was about to go shopping, but I couldn’t go because my friend dropped by.

<br>

/// The meaning of the above construction is similar to that of one of the structures with the complex predicate with ところだ, which will be introduced shortly.

<br>

勉強しようとしましたが、できませんでした。//I was about to study, but I couldn’t.

勉強するところでしたが、できませんでした。//I was about to study, but I couldn’t.

<br>

/// The difference between the two sentences above will be discussed after the explanation of complex predicates with ところだ below.

<br>

## 6: Complex Predicates with ところだ

/// The noun 所 {ところ} has been introduced as a word meaning “place.”

/// ところ used in the complex predicate indicates a place as well, but it refers to a place in time.

/// When ところ is used in complex predicates, it is not written in kanji.

<br>

### (1) With imperfective verbs

/// When the imperfective predicate is embedded before ところ, the sentence indicates that the action expressed has not yet begun.

/// The literal meaning of the sentence is therefore “someone is at a place in time when he or she is about to do something.”

<br>

妹は宿題をするところです。//My sister is about to do her homework.

<br>

/// The perfective copula in the following sentence indicates that the topic was about to do something in the past.

/// Therefore, the setting is in the past, but the action did not take place.

<br>

妹は宿題をするところでした。//My sister was about to do her homework.

<br>

### (2) With perfective verbs

/// When the embedded predicate is perfective, the literal meaning of the sentence is “someone is at the point where he/she just finished doing something.”

<br>

妹は宿題をしたところです。//My sister has just done her homework.

<br>

/// When the copula is perfective, it indicates that the action was completed at a certain time in the past that the speaker has referred to in the discourse.

<br>

妹は宿題をしたところでした。//My sister had just done her homework.

<br>

#### The difference between the two structures

/// The following two structures were presented above in terms of the difference between them because they express a very similar meaning.

<br>

勉強しようとしましたが、できませんでした。//I was about to study, but I couldn’t.

勉強するところでしたが、できませんでした。//I was about to study, but I couldn’t.

<br>

/// The first sentence may be used in a situation in which the speaker has actually started studying but was interrupted many times and could not complete what he or she had intended to complete.

/// The second sentence cannot be used in that situation, as the structure indicates that the speaker has not even started the action.

<br>

### (3) With ~ている

/// It is possible to use the continuous aspect with this complex predicate.

/// The meaning of this construction is “the person is at the point where she or he is in the middle of doing something.”

<br>

妹は宿題をしているところです。//My sister is doing her homework right now.

<br>

/// The sentence above closely resembles the following one in meaning:

<br>

妹は宿題をしています。//My sister is doing her homework (right now).

<br>

#### Difference between ~ている and ~ているところ

/// As indicated above, the continuous aspect may be expressed by ~ている or ~ているところ.

/// The difference between these two structures is that sentences with ~ているところ emphasize the current action rather than the continuous aspect.

<br>

/// ~ている, as has been introduced earlier, may express an ongoing action or an event that has been taking place since some time in the past.

/// This latter meaning may not be expressed by the complex predicate with ところだ.

<br>

妹は九時から宿題をしています。//My sister has been doing her homework since 9:00.

<br>

/// ~ている can also be used to expresses a continuous state.

/// ~ているところmay not be used in these cases, either.

<br>

姉はもう起きています。//My sister is awake already.

### (1) Do you know what I’m saying?

<br>

私の言ってることが分かりますか。//Do you know what I’m saying?

だめだというわけですか。//Are you saying, “No”?

<br>

/// こと refers to the content of what someone has said.

<br>

### (2) It’s good, but…

<br>

どうですか、あの人の日本語は？//How’s that person’s Japanese?

上手なことは上手ですが・・・//It’s good, but . . .

<br>

#### 上手なことは上手ですが・・・ {じょうず なことは じょうず ですが・・・}

/// This expression affirms the addressee’s expectation, but not without a condition.

/// This second sentence means something like, “The person’s Japanese is good, as you might imagine, but . . .” (the speaker obviously wants to add a few qualifying comments).

<br>

### (3) I wouldn’t worry about her

<br>

大丈夫でしょうか。//Do you think she’s all right?

あの人のことだから、大丈夫ですよ。//I wouldn’t worry about her.

<br>

#### あの人のことだから・・・

/// This sentence means something like, “because of who he or she is.”

/// The entire sentence therefore means something like, “Of course she’s all right, because you know how she is.”

<br>

### (4) I really don’t think that’s true

<br>

彼は私の言うことは聞かないと思いますが・・・//I don’t think he’ll listen to what I have to say.

それはどういうことですか。そんなことは絶対にないと思います。//What do you mean? I really don’t think that’s true.

もう一度、彼に言うところですが・・・//I’ll tell him again, but . . .

<br>

#### 私の言うことは聞かない

/// In this case, 聞く means that the person would do what the speaker asked him to do.

<br>

#### それはどういうことですか

/// This expression asks for clarification.

<br>

#### そんなことは絶対にない

/// This expresses a strong negation: “I really don’t think that would be the case.”

/// 絶対に {ぜったい に} is an adverb meaning “absolutely; definitely.”

/// It is acceptable to say this phrase without an adverb, as in そんなことはない, “I don’t think that’s how it is.”stage ３，４。

# Stage 3-4 Sentences of Causation

<br>

## 1: Causative Sentences

/// As mentioned in Stage 1–9, causative sentences, which are characterized by the use of causative verbs, express a person’s causing another person to do something.

/// The situation varies: it could be that the topic forces someone to do something, allows someone to do something, lets someone do something, or has someone do something, depending on the context.

/// In all these situations in Japanese, the topic of the causative sentence is a person with greater authority than the person mentioned in the object position.

/// When the topic has less authority than the person in the object position, a causative sentence may not be used.

/// In this case, other constructions must be used, some of which will be introduced in this chapter.

<br>

### (1) Causative verb formation

/// Group 1: Change る to させる

/// Group 2: Change the final {u} to {a} and add せる

/// Group 3: [する → させる], [くる → こさせる]

<br>

/// All derived causative verbs are Group 1 verbs.

/// The following examples show how they conjugate: たべさせる → たべさせて, かわせる → かわせて.

<br>

### (2) Verbs with no causative forms

/// There are a few groups of verbs that lack causative forms.

<br>

/// - Verbs that express non-actions or non-events lack the corresponding causative verbs.

/// For instance, some semi-transitive verbs, such as ある “to have; to exist” and 要る {いる} “to need,” do not have causative forms.

<br>

/// - The intransitive counterpart in a transitive-intransitive verb pair lacks a causative form:

/// e.g. 開く {あく}  “(something) opens” and 閉まる {しまる} “(something) closes.”

<br>

/// - Honorific verbs also lack causative forms:

/// e.g. いらっしゃる “to be”; “to go”; “to come,” くださる “to give (me),” おっしゃる “to say.”

<br>

### (3) Causative sentences

/// Causative sentences have several different meanings, as shown in the English translation of the example below.

/// In some cases, only the context can determine which meaning the sentence conveys.

/// But in all cases, the person in the topic position has more power than the person in the object place.

/// It is therefore inappropriate to use a causative sentence to express the idea of a person with less power making a person with more power do something.

<br>

先生は学生に日本語を話させます。//The teacher makes/allows/lets the student speak Japanese.

<br>

/// When expressing more than one causative action with the たり-form, the causative element may be either in the final verb する, or in a verb in the non-final position, but not in both.

/// For instance, to describe the things a teacher makes his students do in class, the following sentence uses causative elements in the non-final position.

<br>

先生は学生に漢字を書かせたり、日本語を話させたりします。//The teacher makes his students do things like write kanji and speak Japanese.

<br>

/// In the following sentence, the causative form is in the final verb する.

<br>

先生は学生に漢字を書いたり、日本語を話したりさせます。//The teacher makes his students do things like write kanji and speak Japanese.

<br>

### (4) The use of に and を with directional verbs

/// Some linguists say that different causative meanings can be identified by the use of different particles.

/// For instance, compare the following two sentences:

<br>

中村さんは子供にイギリスに行かせます。//Nakamura-san will allow his child to go to England.

<br>

中村さんは子供をイギリスに行かせます。//Nakamura-san will make his child go to England.

/// Literally, “Nakamura-san will force his child to go to England.

<br>

/// It is commonly said and believed that the use of に conveys the meaning of allowing,

/// whereas the use of を in the second sentence above would imply that the child is going despite his or her wishes to the contrary.

/// It is true that the difference between these sentences can be interpreted that way, but the difference is not as distinct as some linguists believe it to be.

/// Both of these sentences actually more or less convey the meaning of “making someone go somewhere.”

<br>

/// First of all, if this difference exists, it is a very slight one, and is true only when the verb expresses direction;

/// it does not apply to most other verbs.

/// Furthermore, regardless of the particle choice, に or を, the original meaning of the causative sentence still holds for both sentences;

/// that is, a person with power is causing a person with less power to do something.

/// Most importantly, to convey the meaning of allowing a person to do something, a more appropriate Japanese sentence would contain a giving verb in the predicate, as shown below.

<br>

中村さんは子供にイギリスに行かせてやりました。//Nakamura-san allowed his child to go to England.

<br>

### (5) The use of に and を with other verbs

/// In this section, the use of に and を with verbs other than the directional verbs will be examined.

/// See the following example with the verb 笑う {わらう}, which means “to laugh”:

<br>

あの人はいつも面白い話をして、人を笑わせます。//That person always tells funny stories, and makes people laugh.

<br>

/// In this case, the use of を indicates that the topic makes people laugh.

/// It would be unnatural to interpret the sentence as saying that the topic allows or forces another person to laugh, since the verb expresses an involuntary action.

/// For involuntary actions, を should be used for the person who is being made to do the action.

/// A similar example can be found in the following sentence, where the act of crying is an involuntary action.

<br>

あの人はいつも子供を泣かせます。//That person always makes children cry.

<br>

/// In some artificial cases, it is possible for someone to have someone else do things such as laugh or cry.

/// For instance, if a movie director wanted to have an actor laugh in a particular scene, the use of に rather than を would indicate that.

<br>

その時に、チャンさんに笑わせます。//At that time, I will make Chang-san laugh.

<br>

#### General rule for に or を for the person in the object position

/// The basic meaning conveyed by a causative sentence, regardless of the predicate used, is that the person in the topic position makes the person in the object position do something.

/// The implication is that the person in the object position carries out an action as a result.

/// The person in the object position of a causative sentence may be marked either by に or を, but these particles are not interchangeable.

<br>

/// When the verb is a transitive verb, the person who is made to act must be marked by に.

/// を may not be used here, because the direct object of the verb is marked by を.

<br>

あのうちでは、親は子供に自分のご飯を料理させます。//At that house, the parents have the children prepare their own meals.

<br>

/// For intransitive verbs, the person in the object position may be marked by に or を.

/// When を is used, it implies that the action taken by this person is an involuntary action.

/// In the following sentence, being upset is not a controllable action.

<br>

あの人はいつも私を怒らせます。//That person always makes me upset.

<br>

/// The reason some linguists believe that the use of を gives a coercive meaning may be due to this involuntary meaning conveyed by を.

/// That is, the sentence conveys the meaning of “an act not carried out deliberately” by the person mentioned in the object position.

<br>

/// When に is used, it indicates that a person deliberately carries out the action indicated by the verb:

<br>

今日は、スミスさんに泳がせるつもりだ。//I am planning to have Smith-san swim today.

<br>

### (6) て-causatives with ください

/// The て-form of a causative verb with ください indicates that the speaker is volunteering to do something.

<br>

この飲み物は私に買わせてください。//Please let me buy this drink.

<br>

/// The speaker can also use this structure to request that someone else (a third person) do something.

/// In this case, the speaker must be in an authoritative position over both the addressee and the person who is being made to do something.

<br>

掃除は妹にさせてください。でも、洗濯は兄にさせてください。//Have my younger sister do the cleaning. But have my brother do laundry.

<br>

## 2: Other Causative Forms

### (1) Short causative forms

/// There is another set of causative forms called short causative forms.

/// They are used frequently in conversation.

/// The short causative forms can be obtained by changing the causative suffix せる to す.

<br>

/// - Meaning

/// eat wait buy come do

/// - Base form

/// たべる まつ かう くる する

/// - Long causative form

/// たべさせる またせる かわせる こさせる させる

/// - Short causative form

/// たべさす またす かわす こさす さす

<br>

/// All short causative verbs are Group 2 verbs:

/// たべさす → たべさします → たべさして; かえらす → かえらします → かえらして; こさす → こさします → こさして.

<br>

/// Short causative forms are used more often in casual settings than long causative forms.

/// However, there are individual as well as regional differences in the use of long and short causative forms.

/// Compare the long and short causative verbs in the following sentences:

<br>



あの人はいつも私を待たせます。//That person always makes me wait.

/// [long causative]

<br>

あの人はいつも私を待たします。//That person always makes me wait.

/// [short causative]

<br>

### (2) Causative-like verbs

/// Some verbs have inherent causative-like meanings.

/// For instance, 起こす {おこす} means “to wake someone up”; and 着せる {きせる} “to put an outfit on someone else.”

/// These verbs are used as shown below:

<br>

母は妹を毎朝、７時に起こします。//My mother wakes my sister up at 7:00 every morning.

寒い日には、私は赤ちゃんにセーターを着せます。//On cold days, I put a sweater on the baby.

<br>

/// These verbs resemble causative verbs in that the topic causes someone to do or undergo something (e.g. my sister wakes up; the baby wears an outfit).

/// There is, however, a basic difference between the sentences above and sentences with causative verbs:

/// sentences with causative verbs indicate that the topic causes someone to actively do something.

/// Neither of the sentences above indicates such a voluntary action by the object.

<br>

/// In fact, these verbs do have causative forms, as shown below.

/// In the example sentences, the person marked by に actively carries out an action at the topic’s behest.

<br>

母は兄に妹を毎朝、７時に起こさせます。//My mother makes my brother wake up my sister at 7:00 every morning.

私は上の子供に赤ちゃんにセーターを着せさせます。//I have my older child put a sweater on the baby.

<br>

## 3: Other Constructions of Causation

/// The use of causative verbs is not the only way to indicate that someone causes someone else to do something.

<br>

### (1) ~て欲（ほ）しい

/// Recall that the stem with ~たい is a structure expressing the speaker’s desire to do something.

<br>

私はもっと勉強したいです。//I want to study more.

<br>

/// This structure may not be used when the speaker wants other people do something.

/// For this purpose, the て-form of the verb and the adjective 欲しい {ほしい} is used.

<br>

#### Positive

/// The following sentences demonstrate the use of the positive predicate:

<br>

私はあなたにもっと勉強して欲しいです。//I want you to study more.

あの会議では私は森さんに話して欲しいと思っています。//I want Mori-san to speak at that meeting.

<br>

/// Since 欲しい, an emotive adjective, is a part of this structure, this construction may be used only when the speaker is expressing his or her own wish or when the speaker is asking the addressee a question directly.

/// Like other emotive words, this structure may not be used to describe a third person’s wish unless another element is added in the predicate.

/// Many such elements may be added; they all convey different nuances. The following is one such example:

<br>

田中先生は学生にもっと勉強して欲しいようです。//It seems that Tanaka-sensei wants his students to study more.

<br>

#### Negative

/// There are two ways to negate the ~て欲しい construction.

<br>

あの会議では私は森さんに話して欲しくないと思っています。//I don’t want Mori-san to speak at that meeting.

あの会議では私は森さんに話さないで欲しいと思っています。//I don’t want Mori-san to say anything at that meeting.

<br>

/// The difference in meaning between the two is subtle:

/// the first sentence is based on the possibility that Mori-san might say something,

/// but the second sentence does not necessarily assume it.

<br>

#### Causative-て + 欲しい

/// Compare the following three sentences:

<br>

私に行かせてください。//Please let me go.

私に行かせて欲しいです。//I want you to let me go.

中村さんに行かせて欲しいです。//I want you to let Nakamura-san go.

<br>

/// The first sentence is a direct request, while the latter two express requests by using statement sentences.

<br>

### (2) Causatives and ~てもらう（~ていただく）

/// As has been pointed out more than once, only a person with greater authority can be the topic of a causative sentence.

/// For instance, in a case where a mother makes her child do something, the use of a causative sentence is appropriate.

<br>

うちの子に先生に手紙を書かせました。//I made my child write a letter to her teacher.

<br>

/// The following explanation and example sentences deal with a different power dynamic than the one in the situation above.

/// Suppose the speaker needs to ask someone with an equal level of authority to do something on her or his behalf.

/// In this case, it would not be appropriate to use a causative.

/// Instead, the use of ~てもらう (or ~ていただく, depending on whom the speaker asks) is more appropriate.

/// The sentence implies that the topic asked the person in the object position to do something and received the favor as a result of asking.

<br>

私はルームメートに手紙を書いてもらいました。//I had my roommate write a letter for me.

<br>

/// The following sentence is an example of a speaker making a request to someone who is in a position of greater authority than the speaker.

<br>

先生にこれを説明していただきました。//I asked the teacher to explain this to me.

<br>

/// When the speaker wants to volunteer something but needs to ask someone else,

/// then a combination of a causative verb and the verb もらう or いただく is necessary.

<br>

翻訳は私にさせてもらいました。//I requested that I be allowed to do the translation.

<br>

/// The difference between ~てもらう（いただく） and ~てくれる（くださる） may be reviewed in Stage 2–4.

<br>

## 4: Causative-Passive Verbs and Sentences

### (1) Causative-passive verb forms

/// Causative verbs may be changed into passive forms.

/// Since all causative verbs are Group 1 verbs, there is only one rule.

/// [る of causative verbs → られる]

<br>

/// The reverse does not work; that is, passive verbs cannot be changed into causative verbs.

<br>

/// - Base form

/// たべる いく かう する くる

/// - Causative form

/// たべさせる いかせる かわせる させる こさせる

/// - Causative-passive form

/// たべさせられる いかせられる かわせられる させられる こさせられる

<br>

子供の時、私は両親にミルクをたくさん飲ませられました。//When I was a child, I was made to drink a lot of milk by my parents.

日本語の授業では、いつも宿題をたくさんさせられます。//We are always made to do a lot of homework for our Japanese class.

<br>

### (2) Short causative-passive verb forms

/// Just as causatives have the short causative form, there is also a corresponding passive form called the short causative-passive form.

<br>

/// As mentioned earlier, all short causatives are Group 2 verbs that end with す.

/// The rule for changing this into the passive is therefore as follows:

/// [Change the final vowel u to a and add れる]

<br>

/// Examples of short causative-passives

/// - Base form

/// いく まつ かう

/// - Long causative

/// いかせる またせる かわせる

/// - Short causative

/// いかす またす かわす

/// - Short causative-passive

/// いかされる またされる かわされる

<br>

彼と待ち合わせをする時は、いつも待たされます。//I am always made to wait for him when I meet with him.

あの店に行くと、いつも要らない物をたくさん買わされます。//Whenever I go to that store, I am always made to buy many unnecessary things.

<br>

#### Awkward short causative-passive forms

/// The short causative-passives are used most often with the original (i.e. not derived) Group 2 verbs.

/// The original Group 1 and 3 verbs result in the syllable repetition of ささ, which makes the forms awkward.

/// The only verbs among the original Group 2 verbs that produce such an awkward form are those that end with ~す, like 話す.

/// The following illustrates some awkward short causative-passive forms.

/// They are awkward, but some may be used colloquially.

<br>

/// - Base form

/// たべる する くる はなす

/// - Long causative

/// たべさせる させる こさせる はなさせる

/// - Short causative

/// たべさす さす こさす はなさす

/// - Short causative-passive

/// たべさされる さされる こさされる はなさされる

# Stage 3-5 Expressions of Simultaneous Events

<br>

## 1: Review of ながら and あいだ（に）

/// There are many structures that express two simultaneous events in Japanese.

/// Many of these constructions are equated with English sentences in which “while” functions as a connector.

/// Sentences expressing simultaneous events with ながら-phrases and あいだ（に）-clauses were introduced in Stage 2–5.

/// This chapter begins with a summary of the differences between these two structures and goes on to introduce new constructions that express similar concepts.

<br>

### (1) Adverbial phrases with ながら

/// Adverbial phrases with ながら are used to express a secondary action that accompanies a main action when both are performed by the same person.

<br>

私はいつも新聞を読みながら、勉強します。//I always read newspapers while studying.

<br>

/// The ながら-adverbial phrase may not be used to describe simultaneous actions performed by different people, however.

/// In addition, if one of the predicates is stative, not active, the ながら-adverbial may not be used.

<br>

### (2) Adverbial clauses with あいだ（に）

/// An adverbial clause with あいだ（に） may be used for simultaneous actions performed by the same person, or by different people.

/// It can also be used for continuous actions, stative events, and even punctual events.

<br>

/// In the following sentences, two different individuals are doing two different things at the same time.

/// When the action expressed in the main clause is shorter in duration than that in the adverbial clause, the particle に should be used immediately after あいだ.

<br>

子供が寝ている間、私は勉強しました。//I studied during the time that my child was sleeping.

子供が寝ている間に、私は勉強しました。//I studied for part of the time that my child was sleeping.

<br>

/// This construction can be used to express simultaneous states as well as simultaneous actions.

<br>

私は日本にいる間、漢字をたくさん勉強しました。//I studied a lot of kanji when I was in Japan.

<br>

## 2: Simultaneous Events with Other Adverbials

### (1) Adverbial clauses with うちに

/// The most salient feature of the structure in which clauses are connected with うちに is that the condition stated in the うち-clause is expected to change relatively soon.

/// うち comes from the noun うち “inside.”

/// The literal interpretation of the condition marked by うち is therefore something like “within the time that the condition holds true.”

/// あいだ-clauses do not have such an assumption regarding changes of condition.

<br>

お茶が熱いうちに、飲んで下さい。//Please drink the tea before it gets cold.

/// Literally, “while it’s still hot”

<br>

あの人がここにいるうちに、聞いておいた方がいいですよ。//You’d better ask him while he is still here.

<br>

/// Because change is a prominent factor in the うち-clause, negative predicates are often used in this clause.

<br>

雨が降らないうちに、家に帰りましょう。//Let’s go home before it starts raining.

/// Literally, “while it’s still not raining”

<br>

寒くならないうちに、部屋に入ってください。//Please go inside before it gets cold.

/// Literally, “while it’s not cold yet”

<br>

### (2) Adverbial phrases with まま（で）

/// Like ながら-adverbials, adverbial phrases with まま are used to express two simultaneous events concerning the same person.

/// This structure cannot be used to discuss simultaneous events concerning different people.

/// The difference between the two structures is that the verb used in the まま-adverbial phrase must be punctual; that is, non-continuous, in nature.

/// In addition, the perfective form of the verb must be used immediately before まま in this phrase, because the phrase implies a state of completed action expressed by the verb.

/// で after まま is optional.

<br>

電車の中で立ったまま（で）、寝てしまいました。//I fell asleep standing on the train.

/// Literally, “I had stood up on the train, and in that state, I fell asleep.”

<br>

服を着たまま（で）、寝てしまいました。//I fell asleep with my clothes on.

/// Literally, “I had put my clothes on, and in that state, I fell asleep.”

<br>

めがねをかけたまま（で）、泳がないで下さい。//Please don’t swim with your glasses on.

/// Literally, “If you have put your glasses on and are still in that state, don’t swim.”

<br>

### (3) ~ながら with stative verbs

/// ながら-phrases have two different functions.

/// The function introduced in Stage 2–5 describes a secondary action accompanying a main action.

/// The second function, which is introduced in this section, is similar to ~ても or のに.

/// In this case, the verb in the phrase with ~ながら must be stative.

/// Using ~ ながら in this way is quite formal.

<br>

あの人は、家にいながら、電話に出ないのは、変ですね。//It’s strange that he’s not answering the phone even though he’s home.

彼はお金がありながら、物を買うことが好きじゃないんですよ。//Hard to believe, but he doesn’t like to buy things, even though he has money.

<br>

/// With adjectives (including adjectival nouns) and adverbs, ながら is used immediately after the word.

/// That is, the form of an adjective does not change in this construction.

<br>

彼女は、小さいながら、とっても元気です。//Although she is small, she is very energetic.

あの人は、ゆっくりながら、日本語をとても上手に話します。//Although she speaks slowly, she speaks Japanese very well.

<br>

### (4) Conjunctions （そのまま・そのうちに・そのあいだに）

/// The conjunctions used for adverbial clauses introduced in this chapter, such as まま and うちに, may actually be used as sentential and clausal conjunctions.

/// In this case, the demonstrative その must precede them.

/// The following pairs of examples illustrate the sentential and clausal uses of these conjunctions.

<br>

とても疲れて、６時頃、ソファに横になった。でも、そのまま、朝まで寝てしまった。//I lay down on the sofa at around 6:00 because I was so tired. But I ended up sleeping until morning.

とても疲れて、６時頃、ソファに横になったら、そのまま、朝まで寝てしまった。//I lay down on the sofa at around 6:00 because I was so tired, and ended up sleeping until morning.

<br>

テレビを見ていた。そしたら、そのうちに、寝てしまった。//I was watching TV. As I sat there watching, I fell asleep.

テレビを見ていたら、そのうちに、寝てしまった。//I was watching TV, and fell asleep as I sat there.

<br>

私は電話で話していた。その間に、ルームメートは晩ご飯を食べてしまった。//I was talking on the phone. While I was still talking, my roommate finished her dinner.

私は電話で話していたら、その間に、ルームメートは晩ご飯を食べてしまった。//During the time I was talking on the phone, my roommate finished her dinner.

<br>

## 3: Similar Adverbial Phrases

/// There are a number of adverbs and adverbial phrases that are quite close in meaning.

/// Knowing the nuances and implications of each of these is very important for successful communication.

/// Some of these adverbs have been already introduced and used, but the following overview presents them all in the same place.

<br>

### (1) せいで and おかげで

/// To attribute the cause of something to another person or thing, せいで or おかげで can be used.

/// The difference between the two is that せいで refers to a negative cause and おかげで to a positive one.

<br>

あなたのせいで、私は試験に失敗しました。//Because of you, I failed the examination.

/// [i.e., it’s the addressee’s fault]

<br>

あなたのおかげで、私は試験に通りました。//Thanks to you, I passed the examination.

<br>

/// The expression おかげさまで,a more polite phrasing ofおかげで, was introduced in the Preparatory Stage, as in the following:

<br>

おかげさまで、元気です。//Thanks to you, I’m well.

<br>

#### せい or おかげ in predicates

/// せい and おかげ may also be used in the nominal predicate.

<br>

あなたが試験に失敗したのは、私のせいです。//It’s my fault that you failed the examination.

私が試験に通ったのは、あなたのおかげです。//Thanks to your help, I passed the test.

<br>

### (2) ほとんど and めったに

/// Some adverbs, such as あまり, そんなに, and 全然（ぜんぜん）, require the predicate to be in the negative form.

/// There are a few more in this category, including ほとんど and めったに, which will be introduced in this section.

<br>

/// ほとんど, which refers to frequency, means “almost never.”

<br>

私は家にほとんど電話しません。//I hardly ever call home.

<br>

/// The adverb めったに indicates a little more frequency than ほとんど, but it is still not often.

<br>

うちの子供はめったに田中さんのお子さんと遊びません。//My child rarely plays with Tanaka-san’s child.

<br>

/// The adverbs 全然（ぜんぜん）, ほとんど, and めったに differ in degree of frequency.

/// The frequency increases from not at all to more frequent, in the following order:

/// 全然 → ほとんど → めったに

<br>

### (3) わざわざ and せっかく

/// In many Japanese–English dictionaries, わざわざ and せっかく are defined similarly as “deliberately; with much trouble.”

/// Adverbs are in general very difficult to translate into another language, because the implications of a given adverb tend to be quite different in each language.

/// As ever, understanding the underlying meaning of each word is more important than learning it via translation alone.

<br>

#### わざわざ

/// This adverb implies that the topic is doing something even though it is not necessary, and that this task may be a lot of trouble to complete.

/// わざわざ may be used in either a dependent or independent clause.

<br>

わざわざ料理したけれども、だれも食べてくれなかった。//I went to the trouble of cooking, but no one ate it.

このパーティーにはわざわざ着物を着なくてもいいですよ。//You needn’t take the trouble to wear a kimono to this party.

<br>

/// Because of its meaning, わざわざ is often used to thank someone for what he or she did.

/// The grateful person wants the addressee to know that it wasn’t necessary to do what was done.

<br>

遠くからわざわざ来てくださって、ありがとうございます。//Thank you for coming here from so far away.

<br>

#### せっかく

/// This adverb indicates that the speaker is taking advantage of his or her current situation to do additional things.

/// The situation described in the dependent clause, in which せっかく is used, provides the opportunity for the action in the independent clause.

/// Because of this structure, せっかく cannot be used in simple sentences.

<br>

せっかくここまで来たのだから、海にも行きましょう。//Since we came all the way here, let’s take advantage of it and go to the beach.

せっかく日本に来たのに、田中さんに会えませんでした。//I came all the way to Japan, but I was unable to see Tanaka-san.

/// Literally, “it was too bad that I couldn’t take advantage of being in Japan to see Tanaka-san”

<br>

/// せっかく may be used to politely decline an offer or invitation by implying that the speaker regrets not being able to take the opportunity.

/// ですが in せっかくですが in this response implies that a more complete structure is abbreviated.

/// This expression has become a fixed expression for declining an offer politely.

<br>

明日、うちにいらっしゃいませんか。//Would you like to come visit me tomorrow?

せっかくですが、明日は行けません。//Thank you for the opportunity, but unfortunately I can’t take advantage of your invitation and visit you tomorrow.

<br>

/// In some cases, わざわざ and せっかく seem to be interchangeable, but there is a difference in nuance originating from the meanings described above.

/// The use of わざわざ modifies the action in the dependent clause, while the use of せっかく gives the reason for the action expressed in the main clause.

<br>

わざわざここまで来たのだから、海にも行きましょう。//Since we took the trouble to come here, let’s go to the beach as well.

せっかくここまで来たのだから、海にも行きましょう。//Since we came all the way here, let’s take advantage of it and go to the beach.

<br>

### (4) やっと and とうとう

/// The adverbs やっと and とうとう, which were introduced in Stages 2–6, may both be translated as “finally” in a dictionary.

/// However, the notions presupposed by these adverbs are quite different.

<br>

/// やっと is used when the speaker’s expectation is reached after a long wait or prolonged effort.

/// In the first sentence below, it sounds as if the speaker has been waiting for rain for quite some time, and this wish has now been fulfilled.

/// In the second sentence, the implication is that the speaker had been making an effort to understand something, and the goal was finally met.

<br>

やっと雨が降ってきました。//The rain that I was hoping for has finally begun.

やっと分かりました。//I finally understood.

<br>

/// とうとう literally means that something has reached its end.

/// This adverb is often, but not always, used when something that the speaker has been afraid might happen actually does happen.

/// This fear does not have to be very strong, however.

<br>

とうとう雨が降ってきました。//It’s starting to rain; I was afraid it would.

とうとうぼくの犬は死んでしまいました。//I was dreading my dog’s death, and it finally happened.

<br>

/// In both cases, the speaker was fearfully anticipating the event in the sentence.

/// In both sentences, the event occurred despite the speaker’s wish that it would not.

<br>

/// Because of the difference in nuance between やっと and とうとう, confusing them could lead to a terrible misunderstanding.

/// For instance, when a long-awaited visitor finally arrives, it is definitely more appropriate to use やっと than とうとう.

<br>

やっと、来たのね。//You’re finally here!

<br>

/// In contrast, when the speaker fears that eventually it will be his or her turn to face something negative, the use of とうとう is more appropriate than やっと.

<br>

とうとう私の番が来てしまいました。//My turn has come, as I knew it would.

<br>

### (5) Adverb あまり with positive predicates

/// あまり was introduced earlier as an adverb that requires a negative predicate.

<br>

この本はあまり面白くありませんでした。//This book was not very interesting.

<br>

/// When this adverb is used with a positive predicate, it stresses that what is expressed in the predicate exceeds expectations.

/// This adverb, however, is used only in a dependent clause;

/// the main clause must express the consequence.

<br>

この本があまり面白かったから、昨日、全部、読んでしまいました。//This book was so interesting that I read the whole thing yesterday.

<br>

/// When あまり is used in this way, the particle に or にも may also accompany it.

<br>

この本があまりに（も）面白かったから、昨日、全部、読んでしまいました。//This book was so interesting that I read the whole thing yesterday.

でも、物の質はいいですよね。//The quality is quite good, though.

それはそうですね。//That’s true.

<br>

#### 気がする {きがする}

/// This idiomatic verb expresses the speaker’s hunch.

/// The feeling is not based so much on evidence as it is on the speaker’s instinct.

<br>

#### 物の質 {もののしつ}

/// 質 {しつ} means “quality.” The meaning of this phrase is therefore “the quality of things.”

<br>

#### まだまだ

/// The repetition of まだ emphasizes that things are still quite expensive.

<br>

#### それはそうですね

/// When the speaker agrees with a specific point, using それ to refer to it, this expression may be used.

/// おば：

心配しないで。この頃、私、ピンピンしてるんだから。//Don’t worry. I’m quite healthy these days.

<br>

#### ほんの気持ちだけ

/// ほんの means “just a little bit”;

/// 気持ち {きもち} here refers to “the speaker’s thoughts.”

/// So, ほんの気持ちだけ is often used when a person giving a present wants to say that what he or she is about to give is not a big thing, but that it expresses his or her thoughts.

<br>

#### 卒業のお祝いにと思って

/// This phrase means “I thought this might be a good gift to celebrate your graduation.”

/// お祝い {いわい} means “celebration,” but it is also used to mean “gift.”

<br>

#### そんなことない

/// It means something like “It’s not like that,” or “That’s not true.”

<br>

#### 頑張ってちょうだい {がんば ってちょうだい}

/// ちょうだい is a colloquial version of ください.

/// When combined with other verbs, this verb may be used only when speaking to someone younger or to someone with less authority.

<br>

#### 気になる

/// When something is either annoying or worrisome to the speaker, he or she can express it with this idiomatic phrase:

<br>

彼の言ったことが気になる。//What he said was annoying.

母の健康が気になる。//I’m worried about my mother’s health.

<br>

#### ピンピンする

/// This onomatopoeia describes someone in good health.stage ３，６。

# Stage 3-6 Emotive Expressions

<br>

## 1: The Speaker’s vs. the Other’s Emotive Descriptions

### (1) Expressing emotions in Japanese

/// It has been stated previously that different structures must be used to express such things as desires and emotions of the speaker and of the third person.

<br>

/// There are common rules for all structures related to this issue; that is, describing emotions in the first person and the third person.

<br>

/// These common rules are:

/// - The structure that expresses the speaker’s emotions can also be used to ask a second person about their emotions directly.

/// - Emotions experienced by a third person can be stated by adding certain elements to the sentence structure that is used for the speaker. These will be summarized below.

<br>

#### Language of the writer and story-teller

/// The rules for emotive expressions for the first person and the third person often do not apply to stories and novels.

/// In novels, the following type of sentence is used often.

<br>

花子は嬉しかった。//Hanako was happy.

<br>

/// The topic is in the third person, but the predicate consists of an emotive adjective.

/// This is because writers and story-tellers in Japanese often use the language as if they were the speaker of the sentence, even when they use third-person pronouns or personal names.

/// It is important to distinguish such language uses from daily, real-life usage.

<br>

#### What about English?

/// English has no such restrictions on the use of emotive expressions.

/// In the following sentences, the emotive expressions used for first-person and third-person subjects are identical:

/// I am sad. He is sad. I want to go. He wants to go.

<br>

### (2) Expressing a third person’s emotions in Japanese

/// Several different structures have been introduced that may be used to express a third person’s emotive state.

/// Each of these expresses a different nuance.

/// For all examples below, consider the content of the emotive event, “the third person wants more time.”

<br>

/// First, the speaker can report by saying what the third person has told him or her:

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいと言っています。//He has been saying that he wants more time.

<br>

/// If the speaker directly observes that the third person obviously needs time, he or she can say:

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しそうです。//He looks as if he wants more time.

<br>

/// The following is similar to the sentence above.

/// The only difference is that in the sentence above, the need for time sounds urgent; in the sentence below it does not.

/// This sentence describes the speaker’s inference based on his or her direct observation, but it is expressed in more general terms:

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいようです。//He appears to want more time.

<br>

/// The next sentence reports information that the speaker has obtained from an objective source.

/// It is much like the first example, which reported what the third person said.

/// In the following sentence, the information source is not clear unless it is explicitly indicated.

### (In the sentence with 言う, of course, the information source is the third person, who has the feeling).

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいそうです。//I heard that he wants more time.

<br>

/// Sentences with らしい, like the following, are similar to the sentence with そうだ above.

/// The only slight difference is that the information source of the sentence with らしい is not totally objective.

/// The speaker acknowledges its validity.

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいらしいです。//He seems to want more time.

<br>

/// A sentence with はず indicates that the speaker expects his or her assessment of the third person’s emotion or desire to be true because there is some evidence to support it.

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいはずです。//I should think that he would want more time.

<br>

/// Of course, the speaker can also express a third person’s emotive state as his or her own opinion by using 思う.

<br>

彼はもっと時間が欲しいと思います。//I believe that he would want more time.

<br>

/// In addition to the list above, there are still more ways to express a third person’s emotive state.

/// Some of these will be introduced below.

<br>

## 2: Adjective and Verb Pairs

/// Words that express emotions are not necessarily only adjectives.

/// There are some verbs that describe the topic’s emotions.

/// In fact, there are some adjective-verb pairs that have similar meanings, and in some cases, similar forms.

<br>

/// In terms of their uses, generally speaking, the speaker’s own desires and emotions are expressed with adjectives while those of the third person are expressed with verbs.

/// This does not mean, however, that emotive verbs are not used to describe the speaker’s emotions.

/// They are used for objective descriptions.

<br>

### (1) Examples of adjective and verb pairs

<br>

#### 嬉しい {うれしい} vs. 喜ぶ {よろこぶ}

<br>

私は試験に受かって、本当に嬉しいです。//I am very happy that I passed the test.

娘は試験に受かって、本当に喜んでいます。//My daughter is very happy that she passed the test.

<br>

/// This verb may be used to describe the speaker’s emotion objectively.

/// It is used often when the topic is plural and includes the speaker:

<br>

娘が試験に受かって、私達もとても喜んでいます。//We feel quite happy that our daughter passed the test.

<br>

#### 悲しい {かなしい} vs. 悲しむ {かなしむ}

<br>

僕はペットに死なれてしまって、本当に悲しいです。//I am very sad that my pet died.

妹はペットに死なれてしまって、本当に悲しんでいます。//My sister is very sad that her pet died.

<br>

/// The following example has a topic that includes the speaker:

<br>

妹も私もペットに死なれてしまって、本当に悲しんでいます。//Both my sister and I are very sad that our pet died.

<br>

#### 苦しい {くるしい} vs. 苦しむ {くるしむ}

<br>

私は熱が高くて、とても苦しいです。//I have a high fever, and I feel quite miserable.

彼は彼女と別れて、とても苦しんでいます。//He’s having a hard time being separated from his girlfriend.

<br>

/// The following example illustrates how a verb is used to describe a speaker’s emotion objectively.

<br>

彼と彼女が別れたことを聞いて、私もとても苦しんでいます。//I’m finding it difficult to accept their separation, too.

<br>

### (2) Topics of emotive adjectives and verbs

/// The difference between some emotive adjectives and verbs is the relation between the topic and the predicate.

/// With some emotive adjectives, the thing that the speaker has the feeling about may be the topic;

/// with emotive verbs, the person who feels must be the topic.

/// The following adjective and verb pair illustrates this difference.

<br>

#### 楽しい {たのしい} vs. 楽しむ {たのしむ}

/// In the sentence below with the adjective 楽しい, the feeling belongs to the speaker.

/// The topic is the thing about which the speaker feels something.

<br>

大学の生活は楽しいです。//For me, college life is fun.

<br>

/// With the verb 楽しむ “to enjoy,” the topic must be the person who feels:

<br>

友達は大学の生活を楽しんでいます。//My friend is enjoying life at college.

<br>

/// As explained above, with emotive verbs, the first person may be the topic,

/// but in this case, the emotive state is described rather objectively compared to verbs with emotive adjectives.

<br>

私は大学生活を楽しんでいます。//I’m enjoying life at college.

<br>

### (3) Emotive verbs to emotive nouns

/// The stems of emotive verbs can be used as emotive nouns.

<br>

/// - Meaning

/// sadness suffering happiness anger pleasure

/// - Verb

/// 悲しむ 苦しむ 喜ぶ 怒る 楽しむ

/// - Stem (Noun)

/// 悲しみ 苦しみ 喜び 怒り 楽しみ

<br>

/// The following section shows examples of some of these words.

<br>

#### Verbs

<br>

人間は喜んだり、悲しんだり、苦しんだりするとても複雑な動物です。//Human beings are complex animals that feel happiness, sadness, and suffering.

<br>

#### Stems

<br>

あの人は喜びも悲しみも苦しみも感じないのでしょうか。//Doesn’t he feel anything; happiness, sadness, or suffering?

<br>

## 3: From Adjectives to Verbs

/// Not all emotive adjectives have corresponding verbs.

/// In this case, there is a way to make an emotive adjective into an emotive verb.

/// The difference between emotive verbs and derived emotive verbs (formed by adding ~がる) is that,

/// unlike the emotive verbs explained above, the derived emotive verbs may not be used to describe the speaker’s emotions.

<br>

### (1) Suffix ~がる

/// The following rule shows how to derive emotive verbs from emotive adjectives.

/// [Drop い from the emotive adjective and add ~がる]

<br>

/// For instance, the verbal form of 欲しい is 欲しがる.

<br>

/// The following examples illustrate 欲しい for expressing desire in the first person and 欲しがる for expressing desire in the third person in two different aspects, habitual and current.

/// Notice the object marker が for the adjective and を for the verb.

<br>

私は新しい辞書が欲しいです。//I want a new dictionary.

<br>

/// ~ている in the sentence below expresses the current emotional state of the topic.

<br>

山田さんは新しい辞書を欲しがっています。//Yamada-san wants a new dictionary.

<br>

/// 欲しがる in the following sentence expresses a habitual aspect.

<br>

山田さんは私が持っている物は何でも欲しがります。//Yamada-san always wants what I have.

<br>

### (2) Even when there are pairs

/// The suffix ~がる may be used even when an adjective has a corresponding emotive verb.

<br>

#### Emotive verbs and ~がる verbs

/// The adjective 悲しい {かなしい} “sad” has a verbal counterpart, 悲しむ {かなしむ} “to become sad.”

/// This adjective may also be converted into a verb 悲しがる {かなしがる} “to be sad.”

<br>

/// What, then, is the difference between the emotive verbs and the ~がる emotive verbs?

/// As explained above, one difference is that the verb 悲しむ may be used for both the speaker’s and the third person’s emotions,

/// but the derived verb 悲しがる is used to describe only the third person’s emotions, not those of the speaker.

/// Another difference is that emotive verbs objectively describe the topic’s emotional state in rather general terms.

/// On the contrary, verbs derived from ~がる express a more immediate state based on the speaker’s direct observation.

<br>

山田さんは息子さんがアメリカに行ってしまって、悲しんでいます。//Yamada-san is sad because her son has gone to America.

山田さんは息子さんがアメリカに行ってしまって、悲しがっています。//I can tell that Yamada-san is sad because her son has gone to America.

<br>

#### ~がる verbs and stem + そう

/// Both the suffix ~がる and the complex adjectival noun with そう can be used to describe an immediate emotive state, based on the speaker’s direct observation.

<br>

/// What is the difference between these two structures?

/// The complex word with そう expresses an inference.

/// Therefore, in the first sentence below, the speaker really does not know that 山田さん is sad, although evidence suggests it.

/// The verb with ~がる indicates that the speaker actually knows that 山田さん is sad.

<br>

山田さんは息子さんがアメリカに行ってしまって、悲しそうです。//Yamada-san looks sad because her son has gone to America.

山田さんは息子さんがアメリカに行ってしまって、悲しがっています。//I know that Yamada-san is sad because her son has gone to America.

<br>

### (3) From derived adjectives to verbs

/// As previously explained, ~たい expresses the first person’s desire to do things.

/// From this derived adjective, a third person’s desire may be expressed by adding the suffix ~がる.

/// This changes the adjective to a verb:

/// たべる → たべたい → たべたがる;

/// する → したい → したがる;

/// くる → きたい → きたがる.

<br>

/// The following sentences show examples of this construction.

/// The second example illustrates the habitual aspect while the third one describes a current state.

<br>

私はアイスクリームが食べたいです。//I want to eat ice cream.

妹はいつもアイスクリームを食べたがります。//My sister always wants to eat ice cream.

妹はアイスクリームを食べたがっています。//My sister wants to eat ice cream right now.

<br>

## 4: Idiomatic Phrases with 気

/// In this section, some commonly used idiomatic phrases that include the noun 気 {き}, which literally means “mind” or “spirit,” will be introduced.

/// Some of these idiomatic phrases express emotions, and the restrictions on the use of these phrases are similar to those on the use of emotive adjectives and verbs.

/// Being able to use some idiomatic phrases adds variety and sophistication to the language level of the learner.

/// At the same time, it is a challenge to learn such phrases, as they are usually not governed by rules.

<br>

### (1) Emotive idiomatic phrases with 気 {き}

/// The following idioms are used only when the topic is the speaker.

/// When the topic is the third person, another element such as そうだ or らしい must be used (see earlier sections in this chapter for details).

<br>

#### 気がする “to have a feeling”

/// This expression means that the speaker has some feeling or premonition about something.

<br>

今日、母から電話が来る気がします。//I have a feeling that my mother will call me today.

<br>

#### 気になる “to be on one’s mind”

/// This expression means that the speaker noticed something, and that thing has become an annoyance or something that the speaker cannot ignore.

<br>

私のルームメートがあまり寝ていないことが気になります。//I’m a little concerned that my roommate hasn’t been sleeping much.

あの人が昨日、言ったことがとても気になります。//I can’t ignore what he told me yesterday.

<br>

#### 気が重い “to feel troubled”

/// The adjective 重い {おもい} means “heavy.”

<br>

<br>

#### 気が軽くなる “to feel relieved”

<br>

<br>

### (2) Non-emotive phrases with 気

/// Even though the following idioms include 気, they all can be used to describe the speaker as well as a third person.

<br>

#### 気をつける “to pay attention”

/// The verb つける literally means “to attach something onto something else.”

/// The expression therefore means “to pay attention to [= attach the mind] to something.”

/// This idiom is used often in commands.

/// The phrase literally means “the mind attaches itself to something.”

/// It is used to mean “to notice something.”

<br>

私はあの人が毎日、漢字を勉強していることに気がつきました。//I noticed that he studies kanji every day.

彼は私が毎日、漢字を勉強していることに全然、気がつきませんね。//He never even notices that I study kanji every day.

<br>

/// This idiomatic phrase can be condensed into the single verb 気づく.

<br>

私はあの人が毎日、漢字を勉強していることに気づきました。//I noticed that he studies kanji every day.

<br>

/// When the idiom 気がつく is used to describe a person, it means “to be considerate.”

<br>

あの人はよく気がつく人です。//That person is very considerate of others’ needs.

<br>

/// For this function, the condensed verb 気づく may not be used.

<br>

#### 気にする “to be concerned”

/// It was explained earlier that the particle に is used to mark the person who experiences certain emotions or feelings.

<br>

/// It is a set phrase that conveys that emotions referred to in the comment are being attributed to the preceding noun.

<br>

私にとって、花を育てることは大きな喜びなのだ。//For me, taking care of flowers is a great source of happiness.

多くの若者にとって、物がないということはとても苦しいことのようだ。//It seems to me that not having material things is painful to many young people.

<br>

/// The difference between the use of に and にとって is that the latter sounds a little more emphatic in singling out the person who experiences the emotion described.

/// Both に and にとって can be used with は and も, depending on the situation.

<br>

/// When the speaker wants to focus on the contrastive sense, then, は should be used.

/// In the sentence below, 日本人 is being singled out.

<br>

日本人にとっては、英語を話すことはとても難しい。//For Japanese people in particular, it is very difficult to speak English.

/// 必要 {ひつよう}, which means “necessity,” is used both as an adjectival noun and as a noun.

# Stage 3-7 Requests, Commands, and Imperatives

<br>

## 1: Imperative Forms and Sentences

### (1) Terms

/// The terms “request,” “command,” and “imperative” are very close in meaning.

/// The functions defined by these terms, and the structures that convey them, are only generally correlated;

/// there is really no definite one-to-one correspondence between them.

/// It is true that certain constructions are suitable for certain functions,

/// but in any language, different structures may be used for the same content, depending on the situation.

<br>

/// This chapter attempts to show that different structures may be used for a single function, and, likewise, that a single structure can be used for many different functions.

/// It is therefore very important to be able to recognize the importance of appropriate judgment in using the right structure for the right situation.

<br>

#### Making requests

/// In this, the term “request” is used when the speaker asks someone else to do something on his or her behalf.

/// Requests may be expressed by different types of sentences.

/// The following examples therefore are not exhaustive.

<br>

/// When requesting that the addressee do something for the speaker,

/// it is appropriate for the speaker to use ~てくださいませんか if the addressee is someone who is of a higher social status.

<br>

すみませんが、日曜日までにこの手紙を書いてくださいませんか。//I’m sorry to ask you this, but could you please write this letter by Sunday?

<br>

/// When asking the same thing of someone who is senior to the speaker, but only slightly so (e.g., a senpai in a social club),

/// then the following may be more appropriate:

<br>

すみませんが、日曜日までにこの手紙を書いてくれませんか。//I’m sorry to ask you this, but can you write this letter by Sunday?

<br>

/// For a request to a close friend, the use of ~てくれない in the rising tone is sufficient.

/// In this case, the use of すみませんが is too polite.

<br>

悪いけど、日曜日までにこの手紙を書いてくれない？//Sorry, but can you write this letter by Sunday?

<br>

/// A person may ask her or his friend to do something by using the て-form of a verb alone;

/// the use of the conjunctive form here does not have to be interpreted as a command, as one might expect, especially when some confirmation of the previous agreement is added.

/// Here the use of the sentence-final particle ね functions as confirmation.

<br>

悪いけど、日曜日までにこの手紙を書いてね。//Sorry, but I need you to write this by Sunday.

<br>

/// Although colloquial, ~てちょうだい may be used as a request from an authority figure to an addressee.

/// This expression is not as polite as ~てください and should not be used as a public command.

/// For instance, a mother speaking to a child may use this expression to make a request.

<br>

これ、ちょっと読んでちょうだい。//Read this for me.

<br>

/// Many other structures may be used to make requests, as well.

/// Other options will be presented in a later part of this chapter, when issues related to politeness are discussed.

<br>

#### Making commands

/// A “command” is used when an individual with greater authority tells the addressee what to do.

/// For instance, a teacher gives commands to his or her students, as shown below.

/// Even though the teacher is addressing children, she or he uses ください.

/// This indicates that this speech is made in a public place such as a school.

<br>

この宿題は来週、出してください。//Please submit this homework next week.

<br>

/// In a person-to-person interaction, even if it is a teacher speaking to a student, くださいmay be dropped.

/// For instance, when a teacher is explaining to a single student when assignments should be submitted, the following sentence may be used.

/// The speaker’s intent is conveyed through the sentence-final particle.

/// In the sentence below, the use of ね confirms the addressee’s understanding;

/// the use of よ suggests that the speaker wants to make sure that the addressee understands his or her duty.

<br>

この宿題は来週、出してね。//Submit this homework next week.

/// ね or よ

<br>

/// A stem with なさい may also be used to give a command (see Stage 2–6).

/// For instance, an elementary school teacher may give a command to a pupil using this construction.

/// This type of sentence can be used by a mother or a father to her or his child as well.

/// Depending on the situation and the tone used, this construction may be used to give an order or a strong command.

<br>

この宿題は来週、出しなさい。//Submit this homework next week.

<br>

/// The colloquial ~てちょうだい may also be used as a command in appropriate situations.

/// See above for an example.

<br>

#### Giving instructions

/// Giving instructions is a form of giving a command.

/// The only difference between the two is the position of the speaker.

/// When giving instructions, the speaker does not have to be someone who has authority, but is the person who has the information in a certain social setting.

/// For instance, a receptionist could give directions to a customer as follows:

<br>

こちらにお座りください。//Please sit here.

<br>

/// As pointed out in Stage 2–6, written instructions for a test, for instance, are expressed by a stem with なさい.

/// One may also see ~てください in such an instruction as well.

/// In this case, a stem with なさい lends a more authoritative ring to the instruction.

<br>

この言葉を漢字で書きなさい。//Write this word in kanji.

この言葉を漢字で書いてください。//Write this word in kanji.

<br>

/// For giving directions to a taxi driver, ~てください is common;

/// using a stem with なさい would be inappropriate.

<br>

/// As is the case for request sentences, many other structures may be used for commands and giving instructions.

/// These will be presented and summarized in a later part of this chapter, with a special focus on issues related to politeness.

<br>

### (2) Imperative forms

/// An imperative, a stronger form of command, is used when the speaker is ordering the addressee to do something in a very strong manner.

/// One way to express imperatives is by using imperative verb forms.

<br>

#### Positive imperative forms

/// The following chart shows the rules of deriving imperative forms from base forms.

/// Stative verbs such as ある and いる, some honorific verbs, and some intransitive counterparts of transitive-intransitive pairs lack imperative forms because of their meanings.

<br>

/// Group 1: Change る to ろ

///     くれる → くれ（ろ）; normally ろ is dropped for this verb.

/// Group 2: Change the last u to e

/// Group 3: する → しろ, くる → こい

<br>

/// - Ex

/// G1: たべる → たべろ, みる → みろ

/// G2: かく → かけ, はなす → はなせ, かう → かえ

<br>

#### Negative imperatives

/// The negative imperative forms are made by adding な to the positive imperfective form.

/// たべるな, のむな, いくな, するな, くるな

<br>

### (3) Direct imperatives

/// When an imperative form is used alone to make a direct order, the expression sounds extremely harsh and direct.

/// Only a limited number of situations allow such a use.

/// An example could be when a senior member, most likely male, of a sports club is training a junior member:

<br>

走れ！//Run!

止まるな！//Don’t stop!

<br>

/// An older brother might say to his little brother:

<br>

黙れ！//Be quiet!

泣くな！//Don’t cry!

<br>

/// When a sentence-final particle is added to the imperative forms, the expression may not sound so harsh, especially with a falling intonation.

/// With a harsher tone of voice, the sentence could still sound quite rude and punitive.

/// In either case, however, this is used only by male speakers.

<br>

だれにも言うなよ。//Don’t tell anyone this.

食べろよ。//Eat, will you?

<br>

/// What would a female speaker say in these situations?

/// For positive imperatives, using ~て alone or ~ てちょうだい, and for negative imperatives, using ~ないで or ~ないでちょうだい with appropriate sentence-final particles is common.

<br>

黙って（ちょうだい）！//Be quiet!

泣かないで（ちょうだい）！//Don’t cry!

<br>

#### Fixed expressions

/// Some fixed expressions in the imperative form may be used by both genders.

/// The following expression is used to give encouragement, not an order.

/// It may be repeated for emphasis.

<br>

頑張れ！頑張れ！//You can do it!

/// or “Good luck!

<br>

/// The same content can be expressed by the て-form alone as well.

/// The following expression sounds a little milder than the one with the imperative form.

<br>

頑張って！//You can do it!

/// or “Good luck!”

<br>

### (4) Embedded imperative forms

/// Embedded imperative forms are often used to convey what someone was told by someone else.

/// For example, they may be used to express how the speaker was told to do or not do certain things.

/// In such a situation, what the speaker was told can be expressed with the imperative form, even if the imperative form was not actually used in the original statement.

/// Gender need not be considered when imperative forms are used in embedded clauses.

<br>

僕は父に早く帰れと言われました。//My father said to come home soon.

/// Literally, “I was told by my father to come home soon.”

<br>

私はいつも母にそんなに急いで食べるなと言われます。//My mother always tells me not to eat so fast.

/// Literally, “I am always told by my mother not to eat in a hurry.”

<br>

### (5) Imperfective verbs with ように

/// Sentences containing the imperative form of a verb, even within embedded clauses, may still sound quite direct and strong.

/// For a softer approach, the following construction with ように may be used.

/// The verb preceding ように must be in the imperfective form.

<br>

#### With positive verbs

<br>

大きな声で話すように言われました。//I was told to speak loudly.

来月までに終えるように頼まれました。//I was asked to finish it by next month.

<br>

#### With negative verbs

<br>

森さんに来年まで退職しないように言っておきました。//I told Mori-san not to retire until next year.

日本語の勉強を諦めないように言ってください。//Please tell him not to give up on his Japanese studies.

<br>

## 2: Structures for Giving Commands

/// In the above section, it was shown that a certain function, such as a “command,” can be expressed by different structures.

/// In this section, several different functions for which a single structure may be used will be presented.

/// Typical structures for giving a command, such as ~て（ください） and ~て（ち ょうだい）, will not be included here.

<br>

### (1) Stem + なさい

<br>

#### Giving commands to children

/// As explained above, the stem with なさい is used to give a direct command;

/// it is often used by parents to their children, older siblings to younger siblings, or by teachers, especially those of younger children, to their pupils.

<br>

早く寝なさい。//Go to bed early.

もっと、野菜を食べなさい。//Eat more vegetables.

<br>

#### Giving instructions

/// The stem with なさい is also used to give written instructions, especially in tests and examinations.

<br>

この文を日本語に訳しなさい。//Translate this sentence into Japanese.

<br>

/// For other instructions, such as those written in manuals or driving directions, this construction is not suitable.

/// ~てください is better to use for these purposes.

<br>

### (2) ~てはいけない（だめ）

<br>

#### Prohibition

/// The stem with なさい has no negative counterpart.

/// To express this concept, one of the previously introduced constructions used for prohibition, ~てはいけない or ~てはだめ, may be used.

<br>

ここで走っては、いけません。//Running is not allowed here.

ここで走っては、だめです。//It’s not a good idea to run here.

<br>

/// Of course, a negative command, both polite and casual, with ないで is also possible:

<br>

ここで走らないでください。//Please don’t run here.

ここで走らないで。//Don’t run here.

<br>

#### Casual speech, ~ちゃいけない（だめ）

/// Speech tends to be casual when children are being addressed.

/// In casual speech, many things that are not heard in formal speech may surface.

/// For instance, sentence-final particles are used much more frequently; these particles may differ depending on the speaker’s gender.

/// Predicate endings may also differ based on gender.

/// In addition, more contractions may occur in casual speech.

<br>

/// For instance, the following contractions were introduced in the Conversational Devices section of Stages 2–7 and 2–8:

/// ~てしまう → ~ちゃう, ~ておく → ~とく, and ~なければ → ~なきゃ.

<br>

忘れちゃった。//I totally forgot it.

ちゃんと買っとくから、心配しないで。//I’ll buy them, don’t worry.

宿題しなきゃ。//I have to do my homework.

<br>

/// In prohibitions, the ~ては of ~てはいけない or ~てはだめ (as well as other uses of ~ては) is contracted to ~ちゃ in casual speech.

<br>

そんなこと、言っちゃ、だめ。//You shouldn’t say things like that.

<br>

#### Advice for children

/// The colloquial constructions ~ちゃいけない（だめ） may be used by an adult to give advice or suggestions to children.

/// The use of the copula at the end of the sentence is limited to male speakers.

<br>

授業、休んじゃ、だめだよ。//It’s not good to skip school; you know that, don’t you.

<br>

/// A female speaker would say the sentence above without the copula.

<br>

授業、休んじゃ、だめよ。//It’s not good to skip school; you know that, don’t you.

嘘、ついちゃ、だめよ。//You shouldn’t tell lies.

/// Literally, “It’s not good to tell lies.”

<br>

### (3) お + stem

/// Orders using the honorific お with the stem are often given to animals.

お座り！//Sit!

<br>

/// Sometimes a much older person may give such a command to a much younger person,

/// but this usage is extremely restricted, and is used only by a certain type of person.

/// When this kind of construction is used, the speaker is either quite irritated or not very refined.

<br>

お食べ！//Eat!

お行き！//Go!

<br>

#### Fixed expressions

/// Included in any construction are fixed expressions that may not carry all of the implications or meanings of the original construction;

/// the following command is one of these.

/// Most fixed phrases may be used with fewer restrictions.

/// The following command may be given by an adult to a child, for example, and it does not sound as harsh as those above.

<br>

お出で！//Come this way!

<br>

/// The fixed expression above comes from an honorific verb, お出（い）でになる.

/// This honorific verb is for both 行く and 来る, and お出（い）でになる is more honorific than the honorific いらっしゃる.

/// Because it is a fixed expression, however, the honorific implications are not conveyed in the expression above,

/// except in that it is less harsh than others using the same structure.

<br>

## 3: Indirect Commands

/// Commands can be expressed directly or indirectly. The constructions discussed above are direct commands.

/// Commands can also be implied in some sentences. Some ways to express commands indirectly are introduced below.

<br>

### (1) Complex predicates with ものだ

<br>

#### もの as a noun

/// The noun 物 {もの} refers to tangible things or concepts (when used for concepts, もの is not normally written in kanji).

/// こと is often contrasted with 物, as both are translated as “things.”

/// For the difference between こと and 物, see Stage 2–2.

/// In the following sentences, the first 物 refers to a tangible thing, while the second もの refers to a concept.



あの大きい物は何ですか。//What is that big thing?

言葉というものは難しいものだ。//What we call language is a very difficult thing.

<br>

#### Complex predicates with positive imperfectives

/// もの is also used as a functional noun in the complex predicate ものだ.

/// In this case, もの is not written in kanji.

/// This complex predicate expresses commonly expected modes of behavior (such as customs in a certain country).

/// Although the nuance is not as strong as a direct command or imperative, it still indicates a strong expectation.

<br>

/// A construction with a positive imperfective predicate before ものだ is used to convey behavior that the speaker believes is dictated by common sense.

<br>

人を訪ねる時は、いつもお土産を持っていくものだ。//When you visit someone, you should always bring a gift with you.

人から物をもらった時には、きちんとお礼を言うものです。//When you receive something from someone, you should politely thank him.

<br>

#### Complex predicates with negative imperfectives

/// Either the copula or the verb immediately before ものだ may be negated.

/// By negating the copula, the speaker is pointing out the undesirable action that he or she has observed, thereby conveying the message that it should not be repeated.

<br>

そんな失礼なことを言うものではありません。//You shouldn’t say those kinds of rude things.

/// I.e., the person has made the rude statement already.

<br>

/// When the verb before ものだ is in the negative form, the speaker expects that the action will not take place.

<br>

親切にしてもらったら、文句を言わないものです。//Don’t complain when receiving such kindness.

/// I.e., the addressee is expected not to complain.

<br>

### (2) Different meanings with positive perfectives

/// Indirect commands must be expressed with imperfectives.

/// If a perfective is used in the predicate before ものだ, the implication of an indirect command is absent.

/// Instead, the construction indicates that the action referred to is something the speaker used to do in the past.

<br>

僕はこの店でよくコーヒーを飲んだものだ。//I often used to drink coffee at this store.

子供の時、私はよくこの公園で遊んだものだった。//When I was a child, I used to play in this park.

<br>

/// The difference between the imperfective copula だ and perfective copula だった is slight.

/// The nuance that the event occurred quite a while ago is emphasized much more with だった,

/// but this is really a matter of the speaker’s or writer’s perspective.

<br>

### (3) Complex predicates with べきだ

/// The complex predicate with べきだ expresses a strong obligation.

/// The use of べきだ in a complex predicate sounds very objective and impersonal compared with something like ~なければならない.

/// Because of this nuance, it is often used to talk about social expectations or obligations.

/// Note that the complex predicate with ものだ lacks the meaning of obligation.

<br>

先生に謝るべきです。//You should apologize to the teacher.

退職するべきです。//You should retire.

<br>

/// Negatives are only expressed in the copula, not in the predicate before べきだ.

<br>

どんなことがあっても、諦めるべきでは（じゃ）ありません。//One should never give up, no matter what.

<br>

#### Controversial acts

/// The negative perfective of the copula in this construction can be used to indicate that a person has committed a controversial act.

/// The speaker judges that the act, which has already happened, should never have taken place.

<br>

あの人はこんな手紙を書くべきでは（じゃ）ありませんでした。//He really shouldn’t have written this kind of letter.

<br>

## 4: Politeness Levels of Requests and Commands

/// Many structures can be used to express requests and commands.

/// In this section, they are summarized according to their level of politeness.

<br>

### (1) Requests

<br>

#### ~てくださいませんか

/// ~てくださいませんか is one of the most typical constructions introduced as a way to make requests.

/// As explained earlier, the sentence below may be used to request something of your teacher, a senior, or an older non-family member whom you are expected to respect.

<br>

推薦状を書いてくださいませんか。//Can you please write me a recommendation letter?

<br>

#### ~てもらえませんか and ~ていただけませんか

/// もらえる and いただける in these constructions are the potential forms of もらう and いただく.

/// When these verbs are used to make requests, they should be used in the negative.

/// The literal meaning of this construction is something like “Wouldn’t it be possible for me to receive your doing such-and-such for me?”

/// Because of this circumlocution, these requests are much more polite than the one above.

/// They can be used to make requests of the same people addressed with ~てくださいませんか; these structures are simply more polite.

<br>

推薦状を書いてもらえませんか。//Could you please write me a recommendation letter?

<br>

/// Since いただく is the humble form of もらう, using this verb makes the expression even more polite than one with もらう:

<br>

推薦状を書いていただけませんか。//Would it be possible for you to write a recommendation letter for me?

<br>

/// Even more indirect, and thus more polite, is the use of the volitional copula でしょう, as in the following:

<br>

推薦状を書いてもらえないでしょうか。//Do you think it might be possible for you to write me a recommendation letter?

推薦状を書いていただけないでしょうか。//Do you think it might be possible for you to write a recommendation letter for me?

<br>

/// Further politeness can be obtained by changing もらえない and いただけない before でしょうか into the polite forms.

<br>

推薦状を書いてもらえませんでしょうか。//Is there any way that you might write me a recommendation letter?

推薦状を書いていただけませんでしょうか。//Is there any way that you might write a recommendation letter for me?

<br>

#### Casual direct request with ~てくれる？~てくれない？

/// All of the above may be changed into the plain predicates.

/// These sentences may be used for making casual requests of friends or acquaintances.

/// When the negative form is used, it is more indirect, and thus more polite, than the positive ending.

<br>

これ、読んでくれる？//Can you read this for me?

これ、読んでくれない？//Could you read this for me?

<br>

#### Casual indirect request with ~てもらえない？ ~ていただけない？

/// Even though the expression is still casual, the use of the potential with the receiving verbs もらう and いただく is more indirect and polite.

/// The use of いただく is more polite than もらう.

<br>

これ、読んでもらえない？//Could you please read this for me?

これ、読んでいただけない？//Could you please read this for me?

# Stage 3-8 Overriding Particles

<br>

## 1: The Overriding Particle こそ

<br>

### (1) Overriding particles

/// Recall that there are three kinds of particles:

/// 1. linking particles, which connect two elements such as a noun and a predicate, or a noun and another noun (e.g., が, を, の);

/// 2. sentence-final particles, which are placed at the end of sentences to show what type of sentence it is (e.g., か, よ, ね);

/// 3. overriding particles, which add other meanings to the original particles (e.g., は, も, だけ).

<br>

/// This chapter will introduce additional overriding particles.

<br>

### (2) こそ with a positive predicate

/// こそ indicates that, to the speaker, the preceding noun is the ultimate one in its category.

/// Here the term “highlighting” is used to indicate this function.

<br>

#### こそ with a noun

/// If the speaker believes that an ideal teacher possesses a certain quality, and, consequently, that Tanaka-sensei has that exact quality,

/// Tanaka-sensei could be highlighted as in the following statement:

<br>

田中先生こそ私が理想としている先生です。//I consider Tanaka-sensei to be the ideal teacher.

<br>

/// A noun phrase marked by こそ has a meaning similar to one marked with が, which puts emphasis on the topic.

/// The difference between が and こそ is that が can be used only for the topic that is being emphasized, but こそ may be used in other parts of a sentence (e.g., the object position).

/// In the following sentence, 日本に留学すること is actually the object of 楽しみにする.

/// When こそ is used, it is usually placed at the beginning of a sentence.

<br>

日本に留学することこそ、私が一番、楽しみにしていたことだ。//What I’ve been looking forward to, above all, is studying abroad in Japan.

<br>

#### こそ in the predicate

/// こそ may highlight an entire clause, rather than just a noun or noun phrase:

<br>

学生のことを思っているからこそ、たくさん勉強させているのです。//I’m making my students study a lot precisely because I care about them.

勉強は、努力してこそ、意味があるものなのです。//Studying has meaning only when you make an effort.

<br>

#### Fixed expressions

/// The expression こちらこそ was introduced in the Preparatory Stage as a way to respond to an expression of thanks or an apology.

/// For instance, suppose that someone offered the following apology to the speaker:

<br>

本当にすみませんでした。//I’m really sorry.

<br>

/// The speaker could then respond by saying.

<br>

いいえ。こちらこそ。//No, I’m the one (who should apologize).

<br>

/// こそ is used here because the speaker believes that he or she, referred to as こちら, is, above all, the one who should apologize.

<br>

### (3) こそ with a negative predicate

/// A noun modified by こそ in a sentence with a negative predicate is highlighted as an ultimate possible event or condition that did not take place.

/// In this case, the second clause normally indicates that the situation is not bad, despite the fact that the condition has not been realized.

<br>

/// The following example implies that ideally speaking, the book would be published,

/// but the negative predicate indicates that in reality it has not been,

/// but the quality of the book is superb despite this negative condition.

<br>

この本は出版こそされていないが、素晴らしい書物だと思う。//It hasn’t been published, but I think it’s a wonderful book.

<br>

/// The next example expresses that while having money is ideal, this is a condition that has not been met;

/// however, this negative situation has not had a serious effect on the speaker’s life.

<br>

お金こそないが、幸せな生活をしている。//I don’t have money, but my life is quite happy.

<br>

## 2: The Overriding Particle さえ

/// When a noun is followed by the particle さえ, it indicates that it is the least likely thing, person, or event the speaker can imagine in a certain situation.

<br>

### (1) さえ with a negative predicate

/// Because of the meaning that noun phrases with さえ convey, sentences with さえ are often in the negative.

<br>

/// Suppose the speaker cooked something that did not turn out well.

/// The speaker knows that the last person who would complain about such a thing is Mori-san.

/// In the following sentence, さえ expresses that even Mori-san, who would normally eat just about anything, did not eat the food the speaker cooked.

<br>

森さんさえ私の料理に手をつけなかった。//Even Mori-san didn’t touch the food I cooked.

<br>

#### さえ with numbers

/// さえ is often used to indicate the least possible amount.

/// Suppose the speaker wants to express that she or he has no money, the following sentence may be used to express this situation.

<br>

一セントさえ持っていなかった。//I had no money, not even a cent.

<br>

/// The overriding particle も with a negative predicate conveys a similar meaning.

<br>

一セントも持っていなかった。//I didn’t have a cent.

<br>

/// In fact, さえ and も may be combined to emphasize the severity of the situation:

<br>

一セントさえも持っていなかった。//I didn’t have a single cent.

<br>

#### も and さえ

/// Although sentences with も and さえ may convey similar meanings,

/// this does not mean that も and さえ have the same meaning and are thus interchangeable.

/// In fact, they differ slightly in nuance.

/// In the following examples, both も and さえ indicate that people other than Mori-san did not touch the food.

/// The sentence with さえ, however, implies that the speaker expected that at least Mori-san would eat the food,

/// but even this minimum requirement was not fulfilled.

/// Such an assumption is lacking with も. The use of も simply indicates that Mori-san was not an exception.

<br>

森さんさえ私の料理に手をつけなかった。//Even Mori-san didn’t touch the food I cooked.

森さんも私の料理に手をつけなかった。//Mori-san didn’t touch the food I cooked, either.

<br>

### (2) さえ with a positive predicate

/// A noun phrase marked by さえ indicates that this is the least expected person or thing to do something.

/// Suppose the speaker is a comedian, and everyone laughed during his or her performance.

<br>

/// The sentence below indicates that Mori-san is the last person that anyone expected to laugh, and even he or she laughed at the performance.

<br>

森さんさえ笑ってくれた。//Even Mori-san laughed.

<br>

#### さえ with a conditional predicate

/// When used in general statements containing a positive predicate, さえ often accompanies a conditional adverbial clause.

<br>

/// Suppose that the speaker’s minimum requirement for a meal is that there be rice.

<br>

ご飯さえあれば、食事は何でもいい。//As long as there’s rice, anything will make a meal.

ご飯さえあったら、食事は何でもいい。//As long as there’s rice, anything will make a meal.

<br>

/// If the speaker believes that practicing every day is what is minimally necessary to be good at Japanese, then she or he can say the following:

<br>

毎日、練習さえしていれば、日本語は上手になる。//If you at least practice every day, you’ll get good at Japanese.

<br>

#### すら

/// すら is a particle that is very similar to さえ in usage, especially in negative sentences.

/// すら is used more in formal writing and speech, whereas さえ is used for both colloquial and formal writing and speech.

<br>

一セントすら持っていなかった。//I didn’t have a single cent.

<br>

## 3: The Overriding Particle ばかり

/// When ばかり precedes a noun, the phrase indicates that that is the only thing or person that will do or did the action.

<br>

森さんばかり話していた。//Mori-san was the only one talking.

/// I.e., other people did not have a chance to speak.

<br>

/// The overriding particle だけ expresses a similar meaning.

<br>

森さんだけ話していた。//Only Mori-san was talking.

<br>

/// The above sentence with だけ expresses the event as one incident;

/// it is not clear if others wanted to speak.

/// Using ばかり implies that every time the occasion arose to speak, it was Mori who spoke, and he or she did not give others a chance to speak.

<br>

/// Compare the following sentences in which ばかり and だけ are used for the direct objects.

<br>

あの人は野菜ばかり食べる。//All he eats is vegetables.

あの人は野菜だけ食べる。//He will only eat vegetables.

<br>

/// When だけ is used, the sentence says that among the choices that the topic has, he or she chooses only vegetables.

/// This sentence does not imply that this happens every time that the topic eats, which is the implication expressed by ばかり.

<br>

### (2) Complex predicates with ばかりだ

/// When ばかりだ is used in complex predicates, the aspect of the verb before ばかり conveys a specific meaning.

<br>

#### With the positive imperfective form

/// When the verb before ばかりだ is imperfective, ばかり singles the verb out as the only action that the topic will do or does.

<br>

/// In the following sentence, the use of the imperfective before ばかりだ indicates that writing the paper still remains to be completed.

<br>

卒業までに後はこのレポートを書くばかりです。//The only thing left to do before graduation is to write this paper.

<br>

/// The following example indicates that in the past, the student has just had fun and never studied, and implies that this behavior is habitual.

<br>

あの学生は遊ぶばかりで、全然、勉強をしない。//That student just goofs off and doesn’t study at all.

<br>

/// In either case, however, one action is being singled out.

<br>

#### With the positive perfective form

/// When the verb before ばかりだ is in the perfective, the sentence means that the action was completed recently.

<br>

祖母は退院したばかりです。//My grandmother was discharged from the hospital just a little while ago.

<br>

/// This usage of ばかりだ is very similar to the use of complex predicates with ところだ.

/// The difference between the two will be discussed in the following section.

<br>

### (3) Difference between ところだ and ばかりだ

/// Complex predicates with ばかりだ and ところだ are quite similar, especially when the verb is in the perfective form.

/// Sentences with ところだ assume that no time has passed between the completion of an event and the time of speaking,

/// while those with ばかりだ indicate that the event was completed recently,

/// so a short period of time may have passed between the completion of an event and the time of speaking.

<br>

/// In the following examples, because of these meaning differences,

/// the sentence with ところだ might be used on the day of the wedding,

/// while the one with ばかりだ would be used after a short period of time has passed.

<br>

兄は結婚したところです。//My brother just got married.

兄は結婚したばかりです。//My brother just got married.

<br>

/// The following example indicates that the time between when the computer was bought and when it broke was short:

<br>

このコンピュータは、買ったばかりなのに、もう壊れてしまった。//We just bought this computer, but it’s already broken.

<br>

/// In this case, the use of ところだ is inappropriate because the sentence with ところだ indicates that the action of buying was only just completed.

<br>

### (4) Fixed expressions with ばかりじゃなく ~ も

/// The expression ばかりじゃ（or では）なく and も means something similar to “not only . . . but also . . .”

/// The first part may be ばかりではなく, ばかりでなく, or ばかりじゃなく, in order from most to least formal:

<br>

あの人はきれいなばかりではなく、頭もとてもいい。//Not only is she pretty, but she is also very smart.

あの人はほとんど何も食べないばかりでなく、水も飲まない。//Not only is he not eating, but he’s not even drinking water.

外国語は話すことが難しいばかりじゃなく、書くこともとても難しい。//Not only is speaking in a foreign language difficult, but writing is, as well.

<br>

### (5) ばかり with numbers

/// ばかり can also be used after numbers, indicating that the number is approximate.

/// This is similar to the use of ぐらい.

/// The difference is that ばかり has the combined meaning of “only” and “approximately” whereas ぐらい indicates only approximation.

/// Because of this meaning, the number with ば かり gives the sense that the number mentioned is a small amount, at least to the speaker.

<br>

二分ばかり待っていたら、田村さんが来た。//I only waited for Tamura-san for about two minutes, and then he came.

<br>

## 4: Complex Predicates with だけだ

/// The overriding particle だけ is also used in complex predicates.

<br>

### (1) With the imperfective form

/// When the verb used immediately before だけ is in the imperfective form,

/// the structure indicates that the only thing to be done is what the verb indicates:

<br>

旅行の準備は全部した。後は、母に電話をするだけだ。//I’ve done everything in preparation for the trip. The only thing left to do is to call my mother.

<br>

/// The verb before だけ may also be nominalized by こと, as in the following:

<br>

旅行の準備は全部した。後は、母に電話をすることだけだ。//I’ve done everything in preparation for the trip. Now I just have to call my mother.

<br>

/// The difference between the verb with こと and without it is very slight, especially when only one verb is used.

/// Using こと allows more than one verb to be listed in the sentence, however.

<br>

旅行の準備は全部した。後は、母に電話をすることと銀行に行くことだけだ。//I’ve done everything in preparation for the trip. Now I just have to call my mother and go to the bank.

<br>

### (2) With the perfective form

/// When the verb used immediately before だけ is in the perfective form,

/// the structure indicates that the only thing the topic did is what the verb indicates:

<br>

スミスさんに宿題の漢字を教えてあげただけなのに、お礼にと言って、高いコンサートの切符を送ってくれた。//All I did was to help Smith-san with the kanji in her assignment; she gave me an expensive concert ticket in return.

彼に頼んだのに、彼は黙って、向こうに行っただけだった。//I asked him, but he just left without saying a word.

<br>

#### The difference between だけだ and ばかりだ

/// Complex predicates with だけだ and ばかりだ are similar when the verb that precedes them is in the imperfective.

/// With だけだ, the meaning focus is that the only action the topic takes is to respond.

/// When ばかりだ is used, it is possible to interpret the sentence as meaning that each time someone asks, the topic responds.

<br>

あの人は返事をするだけで、後は何もしない。//When asked, all he does is respond; he never does anything.

あの人は返事をするばかりで、後は何もしない。//Whenever he is asked, all he does is respond; he never does anything.

<br>

<br>

### (1) Promise

<br>

森君、来ませんねえ。約束の時間を間違えたんでしょうか。//Mori-kun isn’t here yet. I wonder if he got the appointment time wrong.

森君にかぎって、そんなことはありませんよ。昨日、ちゃんと覚えてましたよ。もうすぐ、来るんじゃないでしょうか。//He wouldn’t do something like that. He remembered it yesterday. I’m sure he’ll be here soon.

<br>

#### 森君にかぎって、そんなことはありませんよ

/// かぎって comes from the verb 限（かぎ）る “to limit.”

/// Used adverbially, this entire sentence means “Mori-kun won’t do something like that,”

/// and 森君にかぎって expresses the notion that “of all people, it would never be Mori-kun who . . .”

<br>

#### 来るんじゃないでしょうか

/// This sentence means “He’ll probably come soon”;

/// literally, “Isn’t it the case that he will come?”

<br>

彼、この頃、忙しすぎるんですよ。//I think he’s really busy these days.

そうかもしれないわねえ。//He must be.

### (3) Perfect timing

<br>

今から、食事なんですか。僕、ちょうどいいところに来ましたねえ。//Are you eating now? I came at the right time, didn’t I?

ちゃっかりしてるんだなあ。//Oh! You’re shameless!

<br>

#### ちょうどいいところに

/// ところ here does not refer to a physical place.

/// It refers to a “place in time.”

<br>

#### ちゃっかりする

/// It may be impossible to capture the concept of this phrase with a single word in English,

/// but it refers to the following kind of behavior:

/// when a person easily or readily takes advantage of the other person’s work,

/// then that kind of behavior is expressed as ちゃっかりする.

<br>

### (4) Polite apologies

<br>

先日は申し訳ございませんでした。//I’m so sorry about the other day.

いいえ、とんでもございません。こちらこそ失礼致しました。//Oh, no, not at all. I’m the one who should apologize.

<br>

#### 先日

/// This is a more formal version of この間（あいだ）, “the other day.”

<br>

#### 申し訳ございません

/// 申し訳 {もうしわけ} means “excuse”;

/// 申し訳ありません literally means that “I have no excuse,” and thus the expression is used to express an apology.

/// 申し訳ございません is more polite than 申し訳ありません, which was introduced in Stage 2–3.

<br>

#### とんでもございません

/// This is a very polite way of responding when someone offers thanks or an apology.

/// This expression means something like “there is no need to thank me/apologize to me.”

/// Even when ありません is used instead of ございません as in とんでもありません, the expression is still quite formal.
