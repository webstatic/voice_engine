# Stage 1-2 Question Sentences

<br>

## 1: Alternative Questions

### (1) The three types of question sentences

/// yes-no question sentences, alternative question sentences, information-seeking question sentences.

/// Yes-no questions are asked to confirm a belief or assumption.

/// Alternative question sentences are either-or questions.

/// Information-seeking questions are asked in order to obtain specific answers to such questions as who, what, where, when, why, etc.

<br>

### (2) Forming an alternative question sentence

/// the two predicates are listed one right after another, separated by phrase divider.

/// Elements like the topic, if it is the same in both clauses, need not be repeated in the second question.

<br>

あなたは雪ノ下さんですか、（あなたは）時雨さんですか。//Are you Yukinoshita-san or Shigure-san?

<br>

#### Clausal and sentential conjunction それとも

/// the use of the conjunction それとも in alternative questions is optional.

/// Using それとも makes the question sound more formal, so in a casual conversation, this conjunction is often omitted.

<br>

あなたは雪ノ下さんですか、（それとも）（あなたは）時雨さんですか。//Are you Yukinoshita-san or Shigure-san?

<br>

#### Noun phrasal conjunction か

/// indicates that the speaker is making an approximate guess

<br>

ナースロボさんは三年生ですか、（それとも）（ナースロボさんは）四年生ですか。//Naasurobo-san, are you a third grader, or are you a fourth grader?

ナースロボさんは三年生か四年生ですか。//Is Naasurobo-san a third or fourth year student?

<br>

今日か明日、行きます。//I will go today or tomorrow.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (3) Responses to alternative questions

#### Choosing one predicate

/// If one of the options given in an alternative question is the correct answer, it should be used in the response.

<br>

あなたは雪ノ下さんですか、時雨さんですか。（私は）雪ノ下です。//Are you Yukinoshita-san or Shigure-san? I'm Yukinoshita.

今日は暖かいですか、涼しいですか。（今日は）とても暖かいです。//Is it warm or cool today? It’s very warm (today).

アメリカに行きますか、日本に帰りますか。アメリカに行きます。//Will you go to America or return to Japan? I will go to America.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

### (4) Negating both predicates

/// If neither of the options stated in the question is true, give the correct response or state it after negating both options of the question.

<br>

#### Nominal predicates 

/// When negating both options -> でもありません.

<br>

あなたは雪ノ下さんですか、時雨さんですか。//Are you Yukinoshita-san or Shigure-san?

いいえ。（僕は）ナースロボです。//No. I’m Naasurobo.

（僕は）雪ノ下でも時雨でもありません。（僕は）ナースロボです。//I’m neither Yukinoshita nor Shigure. I’m Naasurobo.

<br>

#### Adjectival predicates

<br>

今日は暖かいですか、涼しいですか。//Is it warm or cool today?

暖かくも涼しくもありません。とても暑いです。//It’s neither warm nor cool. It’s very hot

どちらでもありません。//Neither is the case.

<br>

#### Verbal predicates

/// When verbs in an alternative question consist of a noun with します

<br>

明日、勉強しますか、運動しますか。//Will you study tomorrow, or exercise?

勉強も運動もしません。//I will neither study nor exercise.

<br>

/// When the verbs in an alternative question contain other types of verbs, the following generic negative response may be used to negate both predicates: 

/// the interrogative pronoun どちら, followed by the particle も and the negative verb しません.

<br>

家に帰りますか、勉強しますか。//Will you go home or study?

どちらもしません。//I will do neither.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 2: Information-Seeking Question Sentences - need to use interrogative pronouns

/// Information-seeking question sentences are interrogative sentences that seek specific responses rather than simply “yes” or “no.” 

/// As is the case with yes-no questions, the word order is the same as in a declarative sentence.

<br>

### (1) だれ(誰), [どなた (何方)] “who?”

/// In order to ask for the name of a person

/// どなた is more polite than だ れ. 

/// In an answer, it is most common to delete the repeated element, as it is understood (in the following examples, the topic こちらは is deleted)

<br>

こちらは時雨さんです。//This is Shigure-san.

こちらはだれですか。//Who is this person?

こちらはどなたですか。//Who is this person?

時雨さんです。//This is Shigure-san.

<br>

### (2) なに（なん）(何) “what?”

/// なに is used when asking about things.

<br>

ナースロボさんは何が分かりますか。//What does Naasurobo-san understand?

ナースロボさんは何語が分かりますか。//What language does Naasurobo-san understand?

ナースロボさんは日本語が分かります。//Naasurobo-san understands Japanese.

<br>

/// In questioning the number, the pronunciation of this pronoun must be なん rather than なに.

<br>

ナースロボさんは何年生ですか。//What year student is Naasurobo-san?

ナースロボさんは一年生です。//Naasurobo-san is a freshman.

<br>

/// なん should be used when asking about a number with a counter or a part of a series

/// なに should be used to ask what things. However, when なに is followed by a word that begins with /t/, /d/, /r/ or /n/, then なん should be used. An exception to this is that before the particle に, either なん or なに can be used.

<br>

それは何ですか。//What is that?

（これは）本です。//This is a book.

<br>

### (3) どこ (何処) “where?”

/// -> asks for a location.

<br>

ナースロボさんはどこに行きますか。//Where will Naasurobo-san go?

（ナースロボ さんは）日本に行きます。//Naasurobo-san will go to Japan.

<br>

### (4) どう (如何) “how?”

/// -> asks for a description.

<br>

英語はどうですか。//How is English?

英語は難しいです。//English is difficult.

<br>

### (5) いつ (何時) “when?”

/// -> ask for the time of an event

/// Since no particle is needed for time adverbs, いつ is not accompanied by a particle either. 

/// A time adverb may be used anywhere except at the end of a sentence

<br>

明日、僕は勉強します。//I will study tomorrow.

僕は明日、勉強します。//I will study tomorrow.

<br>

/// The location of this interrogative pronoun is the same as time adverbs—that is, anywhere but the end of a sentence

<br>

いつナースロボさんは日本語を勉強しますか。//When will you study Japanese, Naasurobo-san?

ナースロボさんはいつ日本語を勉強しますか。//When will you study Japanese, Naasurobo-san?

ナースロボさんは日本語をいつ勉強しますか。//When will you study Japanese, Naasurobo-san?

明日、（日本語を）勉強します。//I will study Japanese tomorrow.

<br>

### (6) どうして (如何して), なぜ (何故) “why?”

/// -> ask for the reason for something

/// どうして is more conversational, while なぜ sounds more formal.

<br>

どうして明日、日本に行きますか。//Why will you go to Japan tomorrow?

なぜ明日、日本に行きますか。//Why will you go to Japan tomorrow?

<br>

/// To respond to “why” questions, からです is added at the end of the response.

/// the predicate before からです must be in the plain form

<br>

勉強するからです。//It is because I will study.

<br>

/// This way of responding to a “why” question is quite conversational.

<br>

### (7) が in the topic position

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 3: Modifying Nouns

### (1) Modifying a noun with an adjective

/// when an adjective modifies a noun, no particle is used between the adjective and the noun it modifies.

<br>

今日はいい天気です。//The weather is good today.

<br>

### (2) Modifying a noun with another noun

/// the particle の must be placed between the two nouns

/// In this structure, the first noun always modifies (that is, explains, describes, or qualifies) the second noun.

/// Since the first noun modifies the second noun, reversing the order of the nouns changes the meaning of the sentence.

/// More than two nouns may be used to modify a noun. In all cases, the last noun is the main noun and all nouns preceding it modify it.

<br>

#### の and demonstrative pronouns

/// The particle の must be placed after these demonstrative pronouns if they are followed by a noun. -> この, その, and あの

<br>

これは本です。//This is a book.

この本は雪ノ下さんの本です。//This book is Yukinoshita-san’s book.

<br>

/// These demonstrative pronouns are also used for personal pronouns, この人, その人, あの人

/// These personal pronouns are less formal than こちら, そちら, and あちら. 

/// Furthermore, こちら, そちら, and あちら are used when the person the speaker refers to is physically present at the time of speech; この人 {このひと}, その人 {そのひと}, and あの人 {あのひと} do not have the same requirement.

<br>

/// The noun after の can be deleted if it is understood, especially when it is inanimate.

<br>

これは私の本です。それはあなたのです。//This is my book. That is yours.

それは私のではありません。//That is not mine.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 4: Adjectival Nouns

### (1) Two types of adjectives: adjectives and adjectival nouns

/// adjectival nouns is a noun in terms of its form but an adjective in meaning.

/// The predicate with an adjectival noun is a nominal predicate. So, when a predicate with an adjectival noun is negated, the negative form of the copula is used

<br>

元気ですか。元気です。//How are you? I am fine.

元気ではありません。//I am not well.

元気じゃありません。//I am not well.

<br>

#### Descriptive particle な

/// the function of adjectives is to describe nouns; they can be used immediately before the nouns that they modify

/// When an adjectival noun modifies a noun, the particle な must be placed between the two words

<br>

今日はいい天気です。//It’s really nice weather today.

今日はいやな天気ですねえ。//It’s really bad weather today, isn’t it?

<br>

雪ノ下さんは元気な学生です。//Yukinoshita-san is an energetic student.

あの学生は元気です。//That student is full of energy.

<br>

#### Summary of how to modify nouns

/// an adjective modifies a noun, use nothing between them;

/// an adjectival noun modifies a noun, use な between them;

/// a noun modifies another noun, use の between them;

/// a verb modifies a noun, the verb must be in the plain form, and the noun follows immediately, with no particle between them.

<br>

### (2) Interrogative pronouns どれ (何れ), どの (何の) and どんな

#### Interrogative pronoun どんな

/// どんな is an interrogative pronoun related to the pronouns こんな, そんな, and あんな, meaning “this kind of,” “that kind of,” and “that kind of.” 

/// どんな therefore means “what kind of.”

/// They must be followed by nouns. な in this set is the same な that joins adjectival nouns and nouns.

<br>

こんな本は高いですか。はい、とても高いです。//Is this kind of book expensive? Yes, it is very expensive.

あの本はどんな本ですか。//What kind of book is that book over there?

<br>

#### Differences between どれ, どちら, and どの

/// どれ “which one” is the interrogative pronoun related to the pronouns これ, それ, and あれ

/// どの “which (noun)” is the interrogative pronoun related to the pronouns この, その, and あの.

/// a noun must follow どの, while どれ is used in isolation. 

/// In both cases, the question focuses on isolating one of many options.

<br>

あなたのかばんはどれですか。//Which one is your backpack?

あなたのかばんはどのかばんですか。//Which backpack is your backpack?

<br>

/// If there are only two options (rather than many), どちら should be used rather than どれ.

<br>

あなたのかばんはどちらですか。//Which one (of two) is your backpack?

あなたのかばんはどちらのかばんですか。//Which backpack  (of two)  is your backpack?

<br>

#### The difference between どんな and どの

/// Both どんな and どの must be followed by a noun. 

/// However, どんな asks for a description, whereas どの only asks for an identification.

<br>

アリスさんはどんな人ですか。//What kind of person is Alice-san?

（アリスさんは）元気な人です。//Alice-san is a cheerful person.

<br>

/// どの asks the listener to identify a specific thing or person out of the available options.

<br>

アリスさんは どの人ですか。//Which person is Alice-san?

（アリスさんは）あの人です。//Alice-san is that person over there.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 5: Conjunctions

### (1) Clausal conjunction が

/// The conjunction が joins clauses, rather than sentences.

/// The conjunction が must be accompanied by a phrase divider, rather than a period.

<br>

/// Contrast: when the speaker wishes to contrast an element in each of the two clauses:

<br>

私は日本人ですが、ナースロボさんはアメリカ人です。//I am Japanese, but Naasurobo-san is American.

<br>

/// Contradiction: when the second clause makes a statement that disagrees in sense with what can be inferred from the first clause:

<br>

私は雪ノ下ですが、（私は）日本人じゃありません。//I am Yukinoshita, but I am not Japanese.

<br>

### (2) Sentential and clausal conjunction けれども

/// けれども, is very similar to が.

<br>

私は日本人ですけれども、ナースロボさんはアメリカ人です。//I am Japanese, but Naasurobo-san is American.

私は雪ノ下ですけれども、（私は）日本人じゃありません。//I am Yukinoshita, but I am not Japanese.

<br>

/// けれども can also function like でも, because it can join two separate sentences.

<br>

私は日本人です。けれども、ナースロボさんはアメリカ人です。//I am Japanese, but Naasurobo-san is American.

私は雪ノ下です。けれども、（私は）日本人じゃありません。//I am Yukinoshita, but I am not Japanese.

<br>

/// More casual forms of けれども delete certain syllables: they are けれど, けど, and (less frequently) け ども.

/// The fewer the number of syllables this conjunction has, the less formal it sounds.

<br>

#### Summary of でも, が, and けれども

/// でも：must be used between two separate sentences

/// が：must be used between two separate clauses

/// けれども：may be used between two separate sentences or between two clauses

<br>

/// が is more formal than けれども. 

/// けれども is more formal than でも, especially when all four syllables are used. 

/// When the number of syllables of けれども is reduced, as in けど, it is less formal than でも.

<br>

ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー

## 6: Adverbs with Negative Predicates

/// Adverbs give a sense of the degree of the description or the degree of the negation that the speaker wishes to convey to the addressee in the predicate.

<br>

/// In Japanese, a speaker must in some cases use different adverbs for positive and negative sentences.

/// Some adverbs are therefore used only with negative predicates.

/// adverbs can soften or strengthen the negation.

<br>

#### あまり

/// とても is used with a positive response while あまり is used with a negative one.

<br>

あの先生はいい先生ですか。//Is that teacher a good teacher?

とてもいい先生です。//She is a very good teacher.

あまりいい先生ではありません。//She is not a very good teacher.

あまりいい先生じゃありません。//She is not a very good teacher.

<br>

/// There are cases in which あまり is used with positive predicates, but the meaning is quite Different

<br>

#### そんなに 

/// is used with a negative predicate, corrects the degree to which a description is assumed or presented to be true.

<br>

雪ノ下さんは本当にいい学生ですねえ。//Yukinoshita-san is really a good student, isn’t she?

雪ノ下さんはそんなにいい学生じゃありません。//Yukinoshita-san is not that good.

<br>

/// そんなに therefore refers back to some previously mentioned, or simply assumed, evaluation.

/// This assumption may be made by the addressee as well as by the speaker. あまり does not imply such reference.

<br>

#### 全然  {ぜんぜん}

/// negates the description in the predicate completely.

<br>

日本は寒いですか。//Is it cold in Japan?

全然、寒くありません。//It is not cold at all.

<br>

二年生でも三年生でもありません。一年生ですよ。//Neither. Actually, we’re freshmen.

一年生ですか。//You’re freshmen, are you?

<br>

/// The function of this kind of repeated sentence is to give the addressee an acknowledgement that one is listening; 

/// very similar expressions to “oh?” “I see,” or “uh-huh” in English

<br>

### (2) Location or name?

<br>

花澤さんの大学はどこですか。//Which university do you go to?

<br>

### (4) Repeating the question before answering

<br>

雪ノ下さんの専攻は何ですか。//What is your major, Naasurobo-san?

専攻ですか。日本語です。//My major? It’s Japanese.

<br>

/// Japanese people tend to repeat a word, a phrase, or sometimes even an entire sentence from the question that was asked before giving a response.

/// This is not rude; it is just a way to confirm that the speaker is responding to the right question. 

/// It also provides an extra moment to think about the response to the question.
